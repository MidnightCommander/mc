   The viewer is implemented along the following design principles:

   Goals: Always display simple scripts, double wide (CJK), combining accents and spacing marks
   (often used e.g. in Devanagari) perfectly. Make the arrow keys always work correctly.

   Absolutely non-goal: RTL.

   Terminology:

   - A "paragraph" is the text between two adjacent newline characters. A "line" or "row" is a
   visual row on the screen. In wrap mode, the viewer formats a paragraph into one or more lines.

   - The Unicode glossary <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/> doesn't seem to have a notion of "base
   character followed by zero or more combining characters". The closest matches are "Combining
   Character Sequence" meaning a base character followed by one or more combining characters, or
   "Grapheme" which seems to exclude non-printable characters such as newline. In this file,
   "combining character sequence" (or any obvious abbreviation thereof) means a base character
   followed by zero or more (up to a current limit of 4) combining characters.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The parser-formatter is designed to be stateless across paragraphs. This is so that we can walk
   backwards without having to reparse the whole file (although we still need to reparse and
   reformat the whole paragraph, but it's a lot better). This principle needs to be changed if we
   ever get to address tickets 1849/2977, but then we can still store (for efficiency) the parser
   state at the beginning of the paragraph, and safely walk backwards if we don't cross an escape
   character.

   The parser-formatter, however, definitely needs to carry a state across lines. Currently this
   state contains:

   - The logical column (as if we didn't wrap). This is used for handling TAB characters after a
   wordwrap consistently with less.

   - Whether the last nroff character was bold or underlined. This is used for displaying the
   ambiguous _\b_ sequence consistently with less.

   - Whether the desired way of displaying a lonely combining accent or spacing mark is to place it
   over a dotted circle (we do this at the beginning of the paragraph of after a TAB), or to ignore
   the combining char and show replacement char for the spacing mark (we do this if e.g. too many
   of these were encountered and hence we don't glue them with their base character).

   - (This state needs to be expanded if e.g. we decide to print verbose replacement characters
   (e.g. "<U+0080>") and allow these to wrap around lines.)

   The state also contains the file offset, as it doesn't make sense to ever know the state without
   knowing the corresponding offset.

   The state depends on various settings (viewer width, encoding, nroff mode, charwrap or wordwrap
   mode (if we'll have that one day) etc.), needs to be recomputed if any of these changes.

   Walking forwards is usually relatively easy both in the file and on the screen. Walking
   backwards within a paragraph would only be possible in some special cases and even then it would
   be painful, so we always walk back to the beginning of the paragraph and reparse-reformat from
   there.

   (Walking back within a line in the file would have at least the following difficulties: handling
   the parser state; processing invalid UTF-8; processing invalid nroff (e.g. what is "_\bA\bA"?).
   Walking back on the display: we wouldn't know where to display the last line of a paragraph, or
   where to display a line if its following line starts with a wide (CJK or Tab) character. Long
   story short: just forget this approach.)

   Most important variables:

   - dpy_start: Both in unwrap and wrap modes this points to the beginning of the topmost displayed
   paragraph.

   - dpy_text_column: Only in unwrap mode, an additional horizontal scroll.

   - dpy_paragraph_skip_lines: Only in wrap mode, an additional vertical scroll (the number of
   lines that are scrolled off at the top from the topmost paragraph).

   - dpy_state_top: Only in wrap mode, the offset and parser-formatter state at the line where
   displaying the file begins is cached here.

   - dpy_wrap_dirty: If some parameter has changed that makes it necessary to reparse-redisplay the
   topmost paragraph.

   In wrap mode, the three variables "dpy_start", "dpy_paragraph_skip_lines" and "dpy_state_top"
   are kept consistent. Think of the first two as the ones describing the position, and the third
   as a cached value for better performance so that we don't need to wrap the invisible beginning
   of the topmost paragraph over and over again. The third value needs to be recomputed each time a
   parameter that influences parsing or displaying the file (e.g. width of screen, encoding, nroff
   mode) changes, this is signaled by "dpy_wrap_dirty" to force recomputing "dpy_state_top" (and
   clamp "dpy_paragraph_skip_lines" if necessary).

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Help integration

   I'm planning to port the help viewer to this codebase.

   Splitting at sections would still happen in the help viewer. It would either copy a section, or
   set force_max and a similar force_min to limit displaying to one section only.

   Parsing the help format would go next to the nroff parser. The colors, alternate character set,
   and emitting the version number would go to the "state". (The version number would be
   implemented by emitting remaining characters of a buffer in the "state" one by one, without
   advancing in the file position.)

   The active link would be drawn similarly to the search highlight. Other than that, the viewer
   wouldn't care about links (except for their color). help.c would keep track of which one is
   highlighted, how to advance to the next/prev on an arrow, how the scroll offset needs to be
   adjusted when moving, etc.

   Add wrapping at word boundaries to where wrapping at char boundaries happens now.
