Fri Dec 25 21:48:51 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_new_inode): Moved initialization of st_ino
	and st_dev from vfs_s_default_stat.

	(vfs_s_default_stat): initialize st_ino and st_dev to zero

	* tar.c (tar_open_archive): Make a new MEDATA->rdev for every
	new archive.

Mon Dec 21 22:55:48 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* tar.c: Deleted global variable tar_gzipped_memlimit.

Wed Dec 16 06:36:42 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* vfs.c (vfs_strip_suffix_from_filename): New function which strips
	known vfs suffixes from a filename and returns a malloced string
	which has to be freed. Possible improvement: strip vfs suffix from
	last path component.

	* extfs/*: added "umask 077" to every script.

Tue Dec 15 16:41:50 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* extfs.c (extfs_open), sfs.c (redirect): create files 0600 and
 	safely w.r.t. symlinks in /tmp

Mon Nov 30 23:49:11 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* direntry.c: Hopefully got want_stale_data right...

Wed Nov 25 23:54:23 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.h: use ENETUNREACH if EREMOTEIO error code is not defined,
 	this is neccessary for Solaris and probably others

Mon Nov 23 17:39:33 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.c (vfs_type_from_op): removing unneccessary code

Wed Dec  9 12:24:52 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* extfs/rpm: commit fix for files with spaces in name by Marc
 	Merlin (marcsoft@merlins.org)

Mon Dec  7 11:04:57 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* fish.c: default to normal ssh
	(open_archive_int): debugging hack killed

1998-12-02  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute files that the
	BUILT_SOURCES depend on.
	(mad.c, mad.h): Don't use GNU make specific features in rule.
	(libvfs_la_SOURCES): Update from Make-mc.in.

1998-12-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_insert_super): This routine does not return
	anything. 

1998-12-02  Sebastian Wilhelmi  <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>

	* fish.c (FISH_OP): changed snprintf to g_snprintf, as glib is
	used anyway.

	* xdirentry.h (LINK_NO_FOLLOW): 
	* tar.c (read_header): 
	* direntry.c (vfs_s_resolve_symlink):
	(vfs_s_inode_from_path):
	(vfs_s_open): renamed NO_FOLLOW and FOLLOW to LINK_NO_FOLLOW and
	LINK_FOLLOW resp. to avoid problems on solaris, where FOLLOW and
	NO_FOLLOW are defined in an enum.

	* vfs.h (ELAST): define it to 300, if not already defined, thats a
	bad hack, but what can we do....

Wed Dec  2 14:06:49 KST 1998  Sung-Hyun Nam  <namsh@lgic.co.kr>

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_new_super): Added the missing return value.

Sun Nov 29 02:54:54 1998  Timur I. Bakeyev <timur@com.bat.ru>

	* vfs.h: (Temporary?) fix to the compiling error: Some of the error
	codes, defined here are Linux specific and unknown to other systems.
	Changed to #ifdef's with assigning new codes by means ELAST+offset.
	
Tue 24 Nov 12:43:20 1998  Peter Kleiweg  <kleiweg@let.rug.nl>

	* vfs.c (vfs_parse_ls_lga): ignore trailing + in permission string
	which indicate a file with extented attributes (ACL)

Mon Nov 23 21:19:43 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* ftpfs.c (resolve_symlink_with_ls_options): that's resolve_symlinks
	we used up to release 4.1.35. It uses LIST -lLa to get symlink stats.

	(resolve_symlink_without_ls_options): that's resolve_symlinks
	we used in release 4.1.36 and 4.5.[01]. It gets symlink stats from the
	directory cache fetching directories if necessary. We got some 
	complaints about slower ftpfs in the above releases. Now this methode
	is no longer the default methode to resolve symbolic links. It is still
	needed for ftp servers which don't understand the LIST -lLa command.
	
	(resolve_symlink): Dispatch between the two methods to
	resolve symlinks.

Sat Nov 21 21:38:08 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.c (vfs_parse_ls_lga): corrected stupid bug in parse_ls_lga,
 	thanks to Pavel Roskin for reporting

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_lseek): -1 is invalid filehandle, not 0

	* utilvfs.c (vfs_split_url): initialize variables so that we do
 	not return garbage

Sat Nov  7 20:19:14 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.c: Converted g_return_if_fail into vfs_dies(), removed them
 	where unneccessary. I do not see why passing NULL to vfs_add_stamp
 	should be invalid -> removed check.

Mon Nov  2 23:09:55 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* direntry.c, xdirentry.h: should be now prepared to handle
 	ftp-like filesystems. This is rather BIG change, altrough it does
 	not look so. I hope I do not break too many things.

Mon Nov 16 16:39:39 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* vfs.c (vfs_parse_ls_lga): Report unrecognized lines.

Thu Nov 12 11:28:48 1998  Pavel Roskin  <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* extfs/rpm: Fix to display files belonging to users with
	excessively long usernames

1998-10-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* fish.c (command): Replace vnsprintf with g_strdup_vprintf.  This
	is both safe and more correct, as there is no limit on the
	pathname. 
	
	* ftpfs.c (command): Same as above.

	* util-alone.c (print_vfs_message): Same as above.
	
Wed Oct 28 17:06:57 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* ftpfs.c: report which directory you are listing, fix behaviour
 	with servers that don't like LIST //. (Nowell) Fix behaviour even
 	with NT.

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_automake): insert newly generated entry

	* direntry.c (vfs_s_free_entry): Debugging printf() killed.

Mon Oct 26 00:38:30 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* Make-mc.in: added xdirentry.h to VFSHDRS

Fri Oct 23 12:29:48 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* tar.c (tar_open_archive): do not double-free memory if you can
 	not open archive, better error handling

	* Makefile.in: add direntry.o to list of NONETFILES so we actually compile

	* sfs.c, tar.c: remove debugging messages (which really should not
 	escape from my tree)

Thu Oct 22 22:24:44 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* README: added. If you are using emacs or hacking libvfs, please
 	read this one.

	* direntry.{c,h}: new library created, so that same entry/inode
 	code does not have to be copied in every handler. 

	* tar.c: converted to use direntry.c library, which means BIG changes. 

	* ftpfs.c: small updates to make code look nicer
	
Mon Oct 19 19:40:58 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.h (&more): killed ERRNOR() from vfs.h and put it into files
 	which actually need it.

	* extfs.c: extfs_current_dir killed - it was unneccessary.

	* mcfs.c (mcfs_get_path): It is possible for path not to begin
 	with /#mc:, for example if user does /etc/#mc:. (It is not
 	correct, of course). Return error, but do not vfs_die().

Sun Oct 18 23:48:00 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* lib/mc.ext.in: cpio support fixed. It was broken since time we
 	started to do #ext syntax.

Sat Oct 17 20:43:20 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.c (mc_open): die() if open is unsupported. If filesytem does
 	not support open, it is probably stupid typo, so we want bug to be
 	fixed.

Thu Oct 22 20:30:28 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* ftpfs.c (resolve_symlink, retrieve_dir): Don't timeout and
	free dcache while resolving symlinks (i.e. don't free some
	pointers which are in use by resolve_symlink). 

Mon Oct 19 11:44:47 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* mcfs.c: prefix is mc:, not mcfs:. So now mcfs actually works.

Thu Oct 15 17:17:17 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* shared_ftp_fish.c (s_write): stupid bug fixed

Tue Oct 13 00:22:52 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* extfs/*: marked obvious security holes with FIXME: TMP RACE

	* vfs.c (mc_def_getlocalcopy): creat->open(..,O_EXCL), to prevent
 	symlink attack, fixed memory leak along the path

1998-10-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c, vfs.h: Indentation chages, ugly macros removed.  I am
	going to split this file in the future.

Tue Oct 13 18:43:18 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@lomikel.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* vfs.c (vfs_add_noncurrent_stamps): Fixed typo reported by Andrej
 	Borsenkow <borsenkow.msk@sni.de>

Tue Oct 13 12:42:10 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* vfs.h (vfs_struct): renamed to avoid namespace conflict

Mon Oct 12 22:42:30 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* sfs.c: reuse mmap from local.c

	* ftpfs.c, fish.c, shared_ftp_fish.c: horrible reget hack removed,
 	and replaced with open(,O_LINEAR); lseek() combination

Sun Oct 11 01:44:37 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* mcfs.c (open_tcp_link): Moved: it used to be in utilvfs.c, but
 	as it deals with portmapper, it is probably usefull for mcfs

	* vfs.h (MCERR_*): these are no longer needed

	* vfs.c (vfs_translate_url): translating of url's moved to vfs
 	code

	* all around: trying to reduce namespace pollution. All special
 	functions (like extfs_run) should be done using mc_setctl()
 	interface. At the end, all non-static functions in vfs layer
 	should begin with vfs_ and should be declared in vfs.h (however
 	that goal is far away).

	* all over the code: replace X_vfs_ops to vfs_X_ops
	
Mon Oct  5 20:11:01 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* vfs.c: added stat to avoid hiding files by naming them
 	#ftp:localhost and similar. Vfs will not treat files as local if
 	they already exists, regardless of name.

Tue Oct  6 15:34:22 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* vfs.h: disable BROKEN_PATHS by default. See if you can live
 	without cd .. from ftp tree putting you to last directory.

Sat Oct  3 14:28:57 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* ftpfs.c (resolve_symlink): fixed cut'n paste error in my last
	change, i.e. make it compile)
	
Sat Oct  3 01:03:37 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* ftpfs.c (resolve_symlink): minor speed enhancement

Thu Oct  1 18:39:52 1998  Pavel Roskin  <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* vfs.h: vfs_force_expire() was incorrectly #define'd

Tue Sep 29 17:23:03 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* extfs.c, sfs.c: added few static's to prevent people from doing
 	stupid things

Mon Sep 28 21:43:16 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* vfs.h (struct vfs): renamed errno to verrno because glibc2 
	defines errno as macro (#define errno (*__errno_location ()))

Mon Sep 28 21:34:03 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <nwarmuth@privat.circular.de>

	* Makefile.in: search config.status in builddir and not in srcdir/.., 
	i. e. make it compile for builddir != srcdir

Sun Sep 27 16:16:52 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* COPYING.LGPL, all over the code: code is now under Library
 	General Public License (instead of GPL), so non-free applications
 	can link to it.

Wed Sep 23 22:37:40 1998  Pavel Machek  <pavel@bug.ucw.cz>

	* all over the code: added (vfs *) as first argument for functions
 	that have no other way to know what fs they belong to. This will
 	be used by object-like tricks, which will allow us to do real
 	code-sharing: I do not like #including of .c files.

1998-09-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* shared_ftp_fish.c: Addaed prototypes for linear_start, linear_read,
	linear_close 

Wed Sep 23 15:09:55 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* vfs.h (MIN, MAX): Only define if not already defined; glib.h
	also defines them.

Wed Sep 23 13:33:14 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* ftpfs.c: Fixed segfault caused by unitialized varialble 

Wed Sep 23 11:51:12 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com)

	* ftpfs.c: Special characters were printed via print_vfs_message.
	This caused funny effects if "XTerm hintbar" was on.

Mon Sep 21 11:40:30 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	* ftpfs.c, fish.c: added O_LINEAR mode to handle linear read of
 	files in sane way. copy_file_file will make temporary files for a
 	while (fix pending).

	* tar.c: fixed bzip/bzip2 compressed archives

Wed Sep 18 12:51:51 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	* fish.c, vfs.c: created aliases /#ssh: and /#rsh:

	* vfs.h: created ERRNOR() macro which sets my_errno and returns,
 	which makes vfs's _much_ more readable

Fri Sep 18 10:37:28 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com)

	* extfs.c: free() was called twice for the same place in memory
	in extfs_open()

Tue Sep 15 20:31:32 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (ftp_use_unix_list_options): New global variable/option. 
	If true we try to use 'LIST -la <path>'. When it fails we use the 
	two commands 'CWD <path>' and 'LIST' instead. 
 
	(resolve_symlink): rewritten. Don't get a second directory listing 
	with `LIST -lLa'. Instead use the cache to get the file stat of
	symbolic links. If the directory the symlink points to isn't
	already in the cache the directory listing will be fetched and 
	stored in the directory cache (without resolving symlinks
	recursively).
 	The new method to resolve symlinks is faster if symlinks
	the same directory or the directory the symlink points to
	is already in the cache.
	This function was small and nice until I discovered that it was
	broken for symlinks to symlinks. Now it looks ugly and perhaps I
	will revert it to use "LIST -lLa" again. With a fast connection it 
	doesn't matter which methode we use but with a slow connection I
	wouldn't hesitate to burn more cpu cycles on the client side.

	(retrieve_dir): Added parameter to tell whether to resolve
	symlinks (don't resolve symlinks in directory listings retrieved 
	while resolving symlinks).
	When we don't get a directory listing with 'LIST -la <path>' then
	try to get it with `CWD <path>; LIST'.

Tue Sep 15 20:27:29 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (login_server): s/ftpfs_get_host/my_get_host/
	
	(retrieve_file_start2): Don't create target file O_EXCL, in 
	copy_file_file we check existance of the target file and know
	that we want to truncate it (this change was already done a 
	while back but it was reverted with the vfs-split).

Tue Sep 15 20:15:42 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.h (struct connection): added boolean which indicates that
	the ftp server doesn't understand Unix ls options

	* ftpfs.h (struct dir): added enum to store symlink status of the
	in memory directory cache (directory has no symbolic links;
	symbolic links but not yet resolved; symbolic links which are resolved)

Tue Sep 15 20:02:08 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* shared_ftp_fish.c, fish.c: updated references to retrieve_dir to
	honour the additional boolean parameter

Tue Sep 15 00:42:15 1998  Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* vfs.h: add vfs_split() declaration, to make sfs.c happy.

	* Make-mc.in, Makefile.am: Updated to include fish.c

1998-09-14  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* sfs.c (sfs_free): assignment operator was used to check for equality

Fri Sep 11 22:36:38 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* sfs.c: memory leak fixed

	* vfs.c: split parse_ls_lga into more functions

	* fish.c added, now you can access files over rsh/ssh connection

	* shared*.c: reworked a bit not to include so many of ugly X_'s

Wed Sep  2 13:59:47 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* ftpfs.c: cleanup of code, few static's added

	* extfs/uarj: added, still, you need patches to unarj to make this
 	work

	* util-alone.c: now includes code from libvfs.c, so we can kill
 	libvfs.c (which is good thing as it was non-standard in Makefiles)
	
Sun Aug 30 13:19:49 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* undelfs.c: fixed, it has been broken for too long

	* vfs.c, ../src/cmd.c: neccessary minor fixes to make undelfs work

	* vfs.c: made more fields in *_vfs_ops optional, cleanup of errno
 	handling in case of NULL in *_vfs_ops.

	* extfs.c, ftpfs.c, tar.c: made use of above change

	* vfs.c: cleanup of macros generating mc_*()

	* libvfs.c: adding variable mc_home

Thu Aug 27 19:45:31 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* extfs.c: mc_extfsdir was not defined in extfs_open()

	* Make-mc.in: sfs.c was not compiled, linked and copied out
	extfs/sfs.ini was not installed and copied out

	* Makefile.am: sfs.c was not linked to standalone VFS

Tue Aug 25 17:54:17 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	* Added vfs_uid for use by libvfs.so users (rpc.nfsd)

	* Added single file filesystem (sfs)

	* Added vfs_flags so library users can disable selected
 	filesystems

	* Minor shuffling of functions so garbage collection works for
 	library
	
1998-08-20  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (mad.c, mad.h): Create symlinks to counterparts in
	`mc-src'. 

Wed Aug 12 19:04:48 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* extfs/patchfs: %k replaced with more portable %H in the format
	for "date" command

	* extfs/extfs.ini: Added patchfs and mailfs. Some comments
	changed

Tue Aug 11 15:25:52 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* extfs/rpm: Fix for buggy "cut" on HP-UX 10.20 which ignores
	lines without enf-of-line.

Mon Jun 01 03:30:07 1998  Alexander Savelyev <fano@vcom.kiev.ua>

	* tar.c (read_header): Support for linkflag on BSDI tar (pax), it
	is always 0.

1998-06-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_open_socket): Potential security break fix.

1998-08-06  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Make it `make dist' friendly.
	Don't try building this, yet.

1998-07-31  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* Make-mc.in (install.extfs): Splitted install of $(EXTFS_CONST)
	and $(EXTFS_OUT) because the first must be installed from
	$(srcdir) and the second from $(builddir).

Fri Jul 24 00:22:30 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Make-mc.in (DISTVFS): Changed Makefile.in to Make-mc.in.

	* Makefile.am: New file.
	* Make-mc.in: Renamed from Makefile.in.
	* Makefile.in: Removed.

Mon Jun 29 15:12:55 1998  Pavel Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>

	* Makefile.in: Rewritten stuff concerning extfs files.

Mon Jun 22 22:30:00 1998  Manish Vachharajani <mvachhar@vger.rutgers.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove arfs, since it doesn't seem to exist

Wed Jun 17 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	* Rename helper scripts (extfs/{rar|lha|...}.in), so their names
	are more logical (and so that things actually work, because new
	names are currently in extfs.ini). 
	
Wed Jun 17 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	* Modified code to use tempnam() instead of tmpnam(), fixed
	tempnam() to use NULL instead of 0. 

Wed Jun  3 Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* libvfs.c: adding libvfs.c which should contain things specific
 	to stand-alone libvfs.so. (This file was missing from previous
 	merge.)
	
Mon Jun  1 16:00:19 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_fill_names): use right character to seperate
	prefix and username

Mon Jun  1 14:19:20 1998  Bakeyev I. Timur <timur@comtat.kazan.ru>
	* vfs.c (parse_ls_lga): allow a bit wider range of listings.

	* vfs.c (is_time, is_year): new functions

Mon Jun  1 12:47:50 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (ftpfs_forget): Use the new ftpfs prefix.

Thu May 28 16:42:31 1998  Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

	* extfs.c, shared.c, tar.c: I changed semantics in my previous
	patch - _get_path() now modifies strings passed to it. I thought
	that I were carefull enough not to introduce bugs. You guessed it -
	I was not. [Many tar_ and extfs_ functions modify strings passed 
	to them, but as they are only called from vfs layer, it does not 
	matter much.]
	So I renamed function to alert everyone that semantics changed. 

	Fixed bugs in timestamping (and segfaults) when you entered tar 
	inside zip file or similar.

	* vfs.c (mc_open): Die if the filesystem doesn't support open

???         Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
	
	* shared.c: Shared parts of extfs.c and tar.c are now in shared.c

	* util-alone.*: VFS should be able to compile stand-alone into
 	libvfs.so usable by anyone. This is first step.

	* vfs.c & others: syntax change. We no longer use
 	tar:/path.tar/file. Now, syntax is /path.tar#utar/file, which has
 	better defined meaning. Similar changes are done to all other
 	protocols. This change touched really _many_ places of code.

	* vfs.c (MC_DIROP): Macro now returns the proper value. 

1998-maj-18  Tamasi Gyorgy (gt_cosy@usa.net)

	* Makefile.in ('install' target): 'mcserv' not installed, if
	net-code is not enabled by 'configure'.

Thu May 14 02:05:52 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* Makefile.in (LIBS): add @LINTL@

Sun May 10 14:51:03 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* ftpfs.c (__ftpfs_chdir): CWD command wasn't sent at all. This
	optimation is wrong because for directories containing spaces we
	have to "CWD <pathname>" and "LIST -la" instead of 
	"LIST -la <pathname>".
	I implemented a different optimation. Now ftpfs_chdir only stores
	the new working directory and sets a flag. __ftpfs_chdir is called 
	when we really want to change the directory on the ftp server. 

	(resolve_symlink): Log the directory listing to the logfile.

	* ftpfs.h (struct ftpfs_connection): Added a (per connection)
	cwd_defered flag.

Mon May  4 10:27:49 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* Makefile.in: Links to mad.c and mad.h were created wrong when
	srcdir != builddir and directory depth to srcdir and builddir were 
	different (e.g. srcdir=/src/mc and builddir=/src/compile/mc)

	* ftpfs.c (retrieve_file_start2): Don't create target file O_EXCL, 
	in copy_file_file we check existance of the target file and know
	that we want to truncate it.

1998-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* tar.c (read_header): Mark regular files with S_IFREG.

Tue Apr 28 06:06:03 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* extfs.c (extfs_open, extfs_close): Changed my_system(1,...) to
	my_system(EXECUTE_AS_SHELL,...), this fixes the broken copyin and
	copyout of 4.1.32.
	
1998-04-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ftpfs.c (retrieve_file_start2): Open file exclusively.
	(retrieve_file): likewise.

1998-03-31  Philippe De Muyter <phdm@macqel.be>

	* vfs.h: compilation fix for m68k-motorola-sysv

Wed Mar 25 19:01:48 1998  Norbert Warmuth  <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* extfs/hp48: Added a usage summary

Mon Mar 23 00:42:21 1998  Christofer Edvardsen <ce@earthling.net>

	* Makefile.in, extfs/extfs.ini, extfs/hp48: New external
	filesystem to view and copy files to/from the HP48.

Wed Feb 11 14:09:02 1998  Oleg <oleg@pobox.com>

	* extfs.c: Add support for writtable external file systems.
	Required for the httpfs. 

Fri Jan 23 07:27:37 1998  Peter Daum <gator@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* extfs.c (open_extfs_archive): Pass the quoted argument to the
	list command. 

	* mailfs: new file system.
	
1997-12-21  Yuri Kuzmenko <Yuri.Kuzmenko@f169.n463.z2.fidonet.org>

        * tar.c: fix the bug which core dumps when trying to view tar file
        with many files (over 60000).

Mon Jul 21 18:47:37 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c (mc_opendir): Do not make conversions between int/void *
	to make the code compile and work on the Alpha correctly.
	Allocate a pointer to an int and use that instead.

Thu Jul  3 19:08:43 1997  Michele Marziani <marziani@axpfe1.fe.infn.it>

	* extfs/rpm: Small fix for older RPM files.

Mon Jun  9 19:00:30 1997  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>
	
	* vfs/vfs.c (vfs_canon): Fix for the 'cd a:/somedir/..' problem

        * vfs/vfs.c (vfs_add_non_current_stamps): when leaving a mtools fs
        free the extfs buffers immediatly instead of waiting for the vfs-
        timeout

Thu May 29 14:50:41 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* vfs.c (vfs_canon): the "local:" case was consuming one extra
	character.  This fixes the bug reported by Andrej.  Also, handle
	the non-canonical case of arguments to  local:

Tue May 27 20:38:28 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@athena.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* mcserv.c (get_client): The parent now waits for the first forked
	process, getting rid of the zombies.

	* utilvfs.c (open_tcp_link): If we can not contact the remote
	portmapper, set the protocol version to 1.

Fri May 16 16:42:18 1997  Tomasz K³oczko, <kloczek@rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl>

	* mc.spec: New spec file, this packages mc, mcserv and tkmc.

	* lib/mcserv.init, lib/mc.sh, lib/mcserv.pamd: added
	
	* vfs/ext/rpm: instead using sed and rpm -qpi use rpm queries,
	more info currently displayed (changeslogs, Os, URL, packager 

Tue May 13 18:14:49 1997  Wojtek Pilorz <wpilorz@bdk.lublin.pl>

	* vfs/Makefile.in (INSTALL_PROGRAM): Use -m flag for install to
	force vfs scripts to be executable on those systems that use
	install.sh 

	* src/utilunix.c: Implement socketpair for SCO flavored systems.
	
Mon Mar 17 12:03:50 1997  Norbert Warmuth <k3190@fh-sw.de>

	* configure.in (--with-hsc): fix.
	
        * vfs/ftpfs.c (ftpfs_get_proxy_host_and_port): Fixed wrong parameter
        passing (HSC_DEFAULT_PORT was passed as pointer to char instead of
        passing it as integer)
 
Tue Feb 25 20:21:00 1997  Joseph M. Hinkle <jhinkle@rockisland.com>

	* extfs/lha: Updated the lha filesystem and included a command
	for running an executable from within an lha archive suggested
	by Zdenek Kabelac <kabi@informatics.muni.cz>

	* extfs/: Renamed cpio, deb, rar, rpm as *.in files and altered
	config.in to create these VFS's for cleaner compilation
