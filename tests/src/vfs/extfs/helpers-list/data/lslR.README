The inputs were taken from:

    http://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/1921

These inputs are supposed to cover:

- "spaces": spaces in dir/file names.

- "iso": ISO date. The ticket claims this is enabled in en_US.UTF-8
  locale, but that's untrue. Nevertheless, it's a useful format (the
  default 'ls' dates are relative and therefore somewhat useless in lslR
  files) so we don't mind covering it here.

- "noshalsh": directories not starting with "./".

Argument files:

The output produced must be constant anytime. Therefore:

- For the one input using non-ISO date we must use --drop-mtime.
  Otherwise, because these are relative dates, next year the output
  will show a different year.

- For all inputs we use --drop-ids for the case we have user "serhiy" on
  our system (and we aren't running as that user).
