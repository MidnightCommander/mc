The input file was created by doing "unace l test.ace" on an archive
created with WinAce (run under Wine; there's no native Linux ACE packer).
One date was then changed by hand to "17.04.94" to test the 1900/2000
boundary.

Known issues with our uace:

- It doesn't support filenames with spaces. (For the benefit of those
  wishing to fix this, the input file intentionally contains such files.)

- It reports '0' gid.

- See note in the source about using Debian's 'unace-nonfree' package,
  not 'unace'.
