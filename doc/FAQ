1 Getting started

1.1 What is Midnight Commander?

   GNU Midnight Commander is a user-friendly yet powerful file manager
   and visual shell, useful to novice and guru alike.  It provides a
   clear, user-friendly, and somewhat protected interface to a Unix
   system while making many frequent file operations more efficient and
   preserving the full power of the command prompt.  After some
   practice, you will wonder how you could ever live without it.

1.2 Does it run on my machine?

   GNU Midnight Commander runs on POSIX (Unix-like) operating systems,
   such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX and others.  It
   can also be compiled under Cygwin on Windows.

   GNU Midnight Commander uses GNU Autoconf which should automatically
   configure it for every Unix clone.  Following configurations have
   been tested in the past (this list is very old):

     * i386-*-linux1.x, 2.x
     * alpha-linux-linux2
     * sparc-linux-linux2.x
     * sparc64-linux-linux2.1
     * mips-sgi-irix5.x, 6.x
     * sparc-sun-sunos4.1
     * sparc-sun-solaris2.3, 2.4, 2.5
     * sparc-sun-netbsd1.0
     * hppa-hp-hpux9
     * hppa-hp-hpux7
     * m68k-apple-aux
     * unixware
     * mc88110-aviion-dgux5.4R2.01
     * i386-*-sco3.2v4.2
     * i386-*-sco3.2v5

1.3 Does it work with my terminal?

   Yes, it does.

   Because GNU Midnight Commander is a full screen program it doesn't
   run on dummy terminals but anything more advanced will do (like
   vt100).  If your terminal works with vi, emacs, elm or pine it will
   work with GNU Midnight Commander.

1.4 What else do I need to run MC?

   You need a POSIX (Unix compatible) operating system.  If you are
   running Windows, use Cygwin.

   To compile any edition you need to have glib >= 2.32  installed.
   It's available at https://download.gnome.org/sources/glib/.

   If you want to use mouse on the Linux console you need the gpm daemon
   from https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/gpm/.  You need nothing
   extra to use mouse on xterm.

   If you do not want to use the S-Lang library you could try using
   ncurses version 4.1 and above.

1.5 Is GNU Midnight Commander Public Domain? Copyrighted?

   Midnight Commander is under GNU Public License which basically means
   that you may freely copy, change and distribute it, but that you may
   not impose any restrictions on further distribution, and that you
   must make the source code available.  This is not the same as Public
   Domain.  For details, the GNU license is included in GNU Midnight
   Commander source distribution (the COPYING file).

   Midnight Commander is now officially a part of the GNU project.
   All the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their rights
   on the program to the Free Software Foundation.

1.6 Where can I get GNU Midnight Commander?

   The main site is https://www.midnight-commander.org

1.7 I cannot compile MC.  What should I do?

   Make sure you have read the INSTALL file in the sources.  Report the
   error messages exactly as they appear, mention the versions of your
   OS, your compiler and whatever else software you think is relevant.
   If you have compile problems in the VFS code, try disabling it by
   using "--disable-vfs" option.

f2 Keyboard

2.1 What does documentation mean with the C-?, M-? and F? keys?

   GNU Midnight Commander documentation uses emacs style names for
   keyboard keys.

   C stands for the Ctrl key.  For example, C-f means that you should
   hold down the Ctrl key and press the f key.

   M stands for the Meta key.  Your terminal might call it Alt or
   Compose instead of Meta.  For example, M-f means that you should hold
   down the Meta/Alt/Compose key and press the f key.  If your terminal
   doesn't have Meta, Alt or Compose or they don't work you can use Esc.
   For M-f press the Esc key and then press the f key.

   Sometimes Ctrl and Alt are used instead of C and M for simplicity.
   Keep in mind that Alt can actually be Meta on some keyboards.

   F? stands for a function key.  If your terminal doesn't have function
   keys or they don't work you can use Esc.  For example, for F3 press
   the Esc key and then press the 3 key.

2.2 Why don't function keys (or some other key) work?

   Your terminfo or termcap database has missing or incorrect
   definitions for function keys.  Type "mc -V" to see what terminal
   database is being used.  If the result is "using the S-Lang library
   with terminfo database" and you are using a very old terminfo
   database, consider installing one of the enhanced terminfo files
   included in GNU Midnight Commander source distribution.  For example,
   if you are using xterm type "tic xterm.ti".

   If the result is "using the S-Lang library with termcap database" you
   should fix your /etc/termcap database.

   Up-to-date termcap and terminfo databases are available here:

     http://www.catb.org/~esr/terminfo/
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/

   If you don't have permissions to edit terminal databases you can use
   Learn keys feature of Midnight Commander instead.  Press Esc 9 o k
   and follow instructions.

   If all else fails you can emulate function keys by first pressing the
   ESC key and then one of the number keys.  For example, if you want to
   produce F9, press ESC, then 9.  If you don't have a ESC key on your
   keyboard you can try alt-9 or meta-9.

2.3 How do I use function keys F11 to F20?

   These are normally mapped to function keys F1 to F10 with Shift held,
   e.g. function key F13 can be activated by pressing Shift-F3.  You can
   define the keys this way in the Options->Learn Keys dialog.  The
   convention for PC keyboards is that F11-20 always means Shift with
   F1-10.

   You may find that on the Linux console with some keyboard layouts
   Shift-Fn is interpreted as F(n+12), not as F(n+10).  This is a result
   of non-uniformity of keyboard layouts.  This is not an intended
   behavior and it may be fixed some day.  In the meantime, use "Learn
   Keys" to remedy this inconvenience.

2.4 Why does the ESC key behave funny?

   Midnight Commander uses the ESC key as a prefix for simulating the
   Meta and Alt keys (for terminals which don't have Meta or Alt, see
   the three previous questions).  For example, pressing ESC-a is the
   same as pressing Meta-a.  In addition most terminals use ESC for
   internal representation of arrow keys, function keys and other
   enhanced keys.  If you want to use ESC to cancel things you have to
   press it twice i.e. ESC-ESC.  If you find this cumbersome you can
   generally use F10 to cancel.  Alternatively turn on the old_esc_mode
   setting in the ~/.config/mc/ini file.  The
   old_esc_mode setting makes ESC work as a prefix only if another key
   is pressed within 0.5 seconds. After 0.5 seconds the ESC key cancels.
   There is no way to make ESC cancel immediately (if we want to be able
   to use arrows keys and function keys).

2.5 How can I add the plus sign (+) on the command line?

   Press C-q first, then press the + sign.

   The plus key is the hotkey for the select files command.  If you want
   to add a literal plus on to the command line you must quote it by
   pressing C-q first.

   Another common key which needs the C-q prefix is backslash "\".

2.6 C-o doesn't work!

   Maybe C-o is a stty control character on your terminal.  See man stty
   for details on how to list and change stty control characters.

2.7 What 'keys' are the "a1" and "c1" keys mentioned in the manual?

   The "a1" key is the key which has the "a1" caption on it.

   The "c1" key is the key which has the "c1" caption on it.

   If you have to ask what these two keys are your keyboard hasn't
   probably got them.  Actually, I have never seen a keyboard which has
   got them.

2.8 How do I change the key bindings?

   Key binding con be reconfigure via keymap files: /etc/mc/mc.keymap
   and ~/.config/mc/mc.keymap.

   You can use the "Learn Keys" dialog to assign keys to some actions
   listed in that dialog.


3 Mouse

3.1 How do I enable mouse support?

   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -x".  If this doesn't work
   upgrade to a terminal which compatible with the Xterm mouse
   sequences.

   Alternatively, on Linux console you can use gpm.

3.2 How do I cut and paste text with mouse?

   Hold down shift key while using mouse to cut and paste.


4 Display

4.1 Why do I keep getting "Terminal not powerful enough for SLang" or
    "Terminal not powerful enough for SLsmg"?

   This means that your terminfo databases do not contain the correct
   definitions for your terminal.

   You could try using a different terminal setting.  If you use csh or
   tcsh:

     setenv TERM vt100

   or if you use sh, bash, ksh or zsh:

     export TERM=vt100

4.2 Why don't line drawing characters work?

   Since version 4.0.13 there's the command line option -a to force use
   of charaters +, |, - for line drawing.  Use the -a option if any
   of the suggestions below doesn't help.

   In general, there are three cases:
     * Lines are shown as ASCII characters like this

      +---------+
      |         |
      +---------+

       This also happens when you use the -a option.  Other than that
       possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).

     * Lines are shown as lower case characters like this

      lqqqqqqqqqk
      x         x
      mqqqqqqqqqj

       Possible reason is 1 or 2 (see below).

     * Lines are shown as blanks or missing characters.  Possible reason
       is 2 or 3 (see below).

   The reason for the problem is one of following:

    1. Your terminal might not support line drawing characters.  VT100
       compatible terminals, rxvt and xterm and color_xterm do support
       them.
    2. Your terminfo or termcap database might have missing or incorrect
       definitions for line drawing characters.  Set the acsc variable
       in the terminfo database like this:
       acsc=a\376k\277l\332m\300j\331n\305w\302v\301u\264t\303q\304x
       \263h\2600\333
       Don't forget issue 'tic' command.  This supposes you are using PC
       character set.  The octal values might be different for other
       character sets.  If you are using termcap instead of terminfo,
       you should modify above solution appropriately.
    3. Your terminal font might not support line drawing characters.
       Try changing the font.

   Here is Miguel's answer to Torben on this subject.

   Torben:

     When I load consolefonts/iso01.f16, I get perfectly right national
     characters, but the line drawing characters in mc get wrong.  Is it
     a mc problem, or is it a problem with the font? (I guess it is).

     Is there a trick?

   Miguel:

     First of all, we should determine whether the font has line drawing
     characters or not.

     If it has line drawing characters, then a new terminfo entry should
     be written for this specific case.  Let's call this linux-iso01.
     The acsc variable should be modified to reflect which characters
     are used to do the line drawing.

     If it does not have line drawing characters, then we should get rid
     of the switch to acsc sequences and make the acsc sequence be just
     a mapping to the ugly +, -, |, - characters.

     You can get your terminfo definition by running the infocmp
     program, making the proper changes and running the tic program to
     compile your new terminfo database.

4.3 Can one use latin-1 characters without losing the lines?

   Yes, you need a correct font and a correct termcap/terminfo database.

   For font, if you use xterm try "xterm -fn fixed".

   For termcap/terminfo database, change the acsc capability in the
   database.

4.4 I have problems with entering/viewing national characters!

   From the Options - Display Bits dialog select Full 8 bits or ISO
   8859-1.  In addition, select 8 bit input from the same dialog.

4.5 How can I get colors?

   Invoke mc like this (without quotes): "mc -c".

   If you get colors, be happy.

   If your terminal stays black and white, your terminal doesn't support
   color.  You might want to upgrade to a terminal which compatible with
   the ANSI color sequences.

   If your terminal goes completely black, see the next question.

   More detailed answer:

   Check that your terminal supports color.  color_xterm, rxvt and Linux
   console do support, most other terminals don't.  You can test color
   support with following simple C program:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main (void){
        printf ("\033[32m Hello world! \033[m\n");
        return 0;
    }

   Compile and run it.  If you see "Hello world!" text in green your
   terminal supports color, otherwise not (however, for color_xterm see
   also the next question).

   Check whether you are using Ncurses or the S-Lang library (type
   "mc -V" to find out).

   With S-Lang library you can force color support by setting the
   environment variable COLORTERM to any value.

   If you use ncurses library, check that your terminfo database
   supports color.  If not, you should install one of the enhanced
   terminfo databases included in GNU Midnight Commander source
   distribution.

   You might want to set the TERM environment variable so that you are
   using the correct terminfo database or termcap entry.

   If you use color_xterm (or rxvt) the correct value might be
   xterm-color, xtermc or simply xterm.

   If you use Linux console the correct value for TERM is linux or
   console.

4.6 My color_xterm goes completely (or partially) black!

   Some color_xterm terminals define all colors as black instead of the
   standard ANSI colors.  This makes them go completely black when you
   try to use Midnight Commander with colors.

   You will have to override the defaults.  Create a file
   "color.defaults" which has the following contents:

    color_xterm*color0:           Black
    color_xterm*color1:           Red
    color_xterm*color2:           Green
    color_xterm*color3:           Yellow
    color_xterm*color4:           Blue
    color_xterm*color5:           Magenta
    color_xterm*color6:           Cyan
    color_xterm*color7:           White
    color_xterm*background:       White
    color_xterm*foreground:       Black

   (replace color_xterm with the name of your color_xterm, color_xterm
   mentions its name in its title bar)

   Now type:

    xrdb -merge color.defaults

   Alternatively you can add the suggested contents of the
   color.defaults file to your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file (or what
   ever the name of your X configuration file is).  Or you can replace
   your non-ANSI color_xterm with an ANSI color_xterm.

4.7 Where can I get xterm or rxvt?

   xterm is included with the X Window System, so you probably already
   have it if you have X.  This version is not actively maintained, but
   Thomas Dickey maintains his more advanced version of xterm at
   ftp://dickey.his.com/xterm/

   rxvt has its own site http://www.rxvt.net/ - get the latest version
   there.

4.8 I got colors working with MC but the other programs don't work at
all anymore!

   Midnight Commander uses terminfo database (if available) but many
   other programs use termcap database.  If you set the TERM environment
   variable to a value which has no corresponding entry in termcap
   database those programs stop working.  You should add the new value
   of TERM to the termcap database.

   Example: If you have set TERM to xterm-color locate from /etc/termcap
   the line which starts:

    xterm|vs100|xterm terminal emulator

   Change it to start:

    xterm|xterm-color|vs100|xterm terminal emulator

5 Graphical user interface

5.1 Xview, Tk and Gnome editions?

   Xview and Tk and GNOME editions have been removed from the sources.

5.2 Why is MC linked with X libraries?

   GNU Midnight Commander is linked with X libraries to read key
   modifiers from the X Server.  It may be helpful to distinguish
   between keys that the terminal emulator reports in the same way, e.g.
   PgUp and Ctrl-PgUp.  Versions of GNU Midnight Commander after 4.6.0
   will load X libraries dynamically on the systems that support it.


6 Command line problems

6.1 How do I stay in the last directory when I exit Midnight Commander?

   See the description of the -P option in the Options section of the
   manual.

6.2 How can I access command line history?

   Meta-h shows the last commands you executed from the command line.
   Duplicates are suppressed from the history.  Commands executed from
   the subshell prompt are not shown.

   You can put previous commands to the command line with Meta-p.  Meta-n
   moves you forward in history.

   Since version 4.1.15 all the input widgets have permanent history.
   You can summon the history listbox by pressing M-h.

6.3 How can I complete commands, file names, variable names and so on?

   Just press M-Tab.  Press M-Tab again to get a listbox if there are
   multiple possible completions.

6.4 I am using ksh.  Can I use functions defined in the .kshrc within
MC?

   Sorry, MC only supports bash, tcsh and zsh functions.  Ksh functions
   are not supported because ksh lacks the necessary hooks needed for
   subshell integration.

   Switch to bash or zsh.  They are both quite compatible with ksh. 
   Your ksh functions should work as such or after minimal changes.

6.5 Is there any way to include additional options or hot keys to MC?

   Yes, F2 invokes an user menu,  which is fully configurable.  You can
   add any shell commands to the user menu.  See the mc(1) man page for
   more info.

   Another way to add functionality is the external panelize feature.
   See the mc(1) man page for more info.

   And finally, you can code any feature you want yourself.  MC source
   code is free which means you can change it anyway you want.  There
   are some limitations to make sure MC stays free.  See GNU General
   Public License for details.

6.6 When I use Ctrl-O I don't get a subshell.  How do I fix this?

   Only bash, tcsh and zsh can be used as subshell.  Use one of those
   shells as your default shell, and it will be used as subshell in GNU
   Midnight Commander.

6.7 Ctrl-O doesn't work at all.  What happens?

   Ctrl-O works if either the subshell is used or the terminal can save
   the output of the commands so it can be restored.  If neither is
   true, there is absolutely nothing interesting behind the panels!

   Only few terminals support screen saving.  It's xterm, rxvt and other
   xterm-like terminals and virtual terminals on Linux and FreeBSD.

6.8 Why I see lot of strange 'cd "printf ' lines into my .history file?

  Add

    export HISTCONTROL="ignoreboth"

  into your ~/.profile file (.bash_profile) for avoid this.

6.9 I have a problem with Screen which makes using Midnight Commander
problematic. I use Ctrl-O to disable panels. Output of previous commands,
just a clear, screen is blanked.

  Update GNU Screen to the last version. This bug was fixed in

   commit ad56f746c6243d45124485d198d577bdbb78071c
   Author: Sadrul Habib Chowdhury <sadrul@users.sourceforge.net>

       Fix using alternate screen buffers in some cases.

       Screen would reset the 'main' screen buffer if an app tries to
       switch to an alternate buffer while it is already using one (in
       other words, sends multiple 'smcup' without an 'rmcup'). This should
       fix debian #558724

  (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=558724)

  or do not rewrite TERM (mustbe TERM=screen) andrun mc as follow:

   echo -e '\e[?1000h' && mc -x

7 Virtual file systems

7.1 How can I see the contents of a tar archive?

   If you use keyboard just move the selection bar on the tar file and
   press enter.  If you use mouse just double-click on the tar file.

   The recognized suffixes for tar archives are .tar, .tar.gz and .tgz.
   You can also enter a tar archive by typing "cd filename/utar://" where
   filename is the name of the archive.  In this case, the suffix is not
   important.

7.2 How do I get out of a tar archive?

   Just press enter on the toplevel ".." file or change to a non-tar
   directory.  Just typing "cd" with no parameters is enough (it will
   take you to your home directory).

7.3 How do I do anonymous ftp with MC?

   Just type "cd ftp://hostname" where hostname is the name of the host
   you want to connect.  Alternatively, select FTP link from the Left or
   Right menu and type the name of the host you want to connect.

7.4 How do I do non-anonymous ftp with MC?

   Non-anonymous ftp works just like the anonymous ftp but you give the
   login name with the host name.  For example, type "cd
   ftp://username@hostname".

7.5 How do I close an ftp connection?

   Just change to a non-ftp directory.  Simply typing "cd" with no
   parameters is enough (it will take you to your home directory).

   GNU Midnight Commander closes ftp connection automatically after a
   timeout or on exit.  It's possible to force disconnect by selecting
   "Command" -> "Active VFS List" in the menu and using the "Free VFSs
   Now" button.

7.6 Why aren't the contents of ftp panel updated?

   Update is skipped because there would be a serious performance
   penalty.  Constantly updating directory panels through a ftp
   connection would take too much time.

   You can use C-r to force an update.

7.7 What kind of proxy server works with Midnight Commander?

   There are two kinds of ftp proxies: proxies for ftp clients and
   proxies for web browsers.

   Midnight Commander only supports ftp proxies which are meant for ftp
   clients.  Common WWW proxies (like Squid) are not supported.  A rule
   of thumb is that if a ftp proxy requires a web browser, it won't work
   with Midnight Commander.


8 Other common problems

8.1 When I try pasting to the internal editor, it indents the amount of
indenting increases with each line!

   Either turn off 'Return does autoindent' in the editor options or
   update GNU Midnight Commander to version 4.6.0 or above - it doesn't
   autoindent when you are holding Shift.

8.2 Is it possible to use Colorer for syntax highlighting?

   Yes if you submit the patch.  There are no legal problems with it
   because it's licensed under GPL now.  The homepage of Colorer is
   http://colorer.sourceforge.net/


9 Other common problems

9.1 Is there any way to 'bookmark' favorite ftp-fs links?

   Use the directory hotlist.  Just press control-backslash.  If your
   national keyboard layout doesn't have backslash key, just press the
   control key with the key which is the backslash key in the English
   keyboard layout.

9.2 When I start Midnight Commander, nothing happens!

   First, invoke MC without subshell support: "mc -u".  If this helps
   check the shell you are using.  Subshell support works best with
   bash, although tcsh and zsh are also supported.  You might want to
   upgrade your shell to a newer version.  If you use something else
   than bash, tcsh or zsh, subshell support is disabled automatically.

   Another reason is problems with gpm.  Try using "--nomouse" option to
   see if it makes any difference.  Restarting gpm can help.  Sometimes
   it's enough to move the mouse.

   Also, if you have the DISPLAY environment variable set, but the X
   server is unreachable (e.g. it's firewalled), this can also cause a
   delay at startup.  Unset DISPLAY to see if that's the case.

   Current list of active developers can be found here:
   https://www.midnight-commander.org/wiki/McDevelopers

   This page lists everbody who has provided a patch or
   has written code for the Midnight Commander in the past:
   https://www.midnight-commander.org/wiki/McContributors

10.2 Do I dare to use a development version?

   Yes, of course. Feel free to test:
   https://www.midnight-commander.org/wiki#Download
   As we do our development in git, please do a git checkout
   of the master branch and build it

   But always remember: development versions may have nasty bugs
   at some points of time.  It's up to you to judge whether the new
   features and fixes for the bugs you know outweigh the risk of unknown
   bugs.

10.3 How can I report a bug/request for a feature?

   You might first want to get the newest development version to see if
   the bug is fixed or the feature is added already.

   If this is not the case, feel free to add a ticket in our ticket system,
   which is located here: https://www.midnight-commander.org/newticket

   If you want to send an email instead write your report to
   mc-devel@lists.midnight-commander.org or mc@lists.midnight-commander.org.

   These mailing lists are the most certain way to contact the
   developers.  Remember to mention if you are not on the mailing list
   to make sure that you will receive a copy of replies.

   Give as much details as possible.  A too long message is a lot better
   than a too short message.

   For segmentation faults a stack backtrace is appreciated.  You can
   produce stack backtrace as follows:
     * If segmentation fault produced a core file:
         1. Load the core file by typing "gdb mc core" or "dbx mc core".
         2. Type "where".
         3. Cut and paste the results to your message.
     * If segmentation fault didn't produce a core file:
         1. Load mc by typing "gdb mc" or "dbx mc".
         2. Start mc by typing "run".
         3. Try to reproduce the segmentation fault by doing whatever
            you did last time when the segmentation fault occurred.
         4. Type "where".
         5. Cut and paste the results to your message.
         6. For the future you might want to check out what is the
            command in your shell to allow producing of the core files.
            Usually it is "limit coredumpsize unlimited" or "ulimit
            coredumpsize" or "ulimit -c unlimited".

10.4 How can I join the development?

   To join the development just code the feature you want to add and
   send your patch for inclusion.  Email address is mc-devel@lists.midnight-commander.org.
   Before you start coding check the latest development version.  It
   might be that your feature has already been implemented.

   Note that the authors of GNU Midnight Commander have given all their
   rights on the program to the Free Software Foundation.  You will have
   to do the same if you contribute non-trivial patches.  Otherwise we
   have to reject your patches in order to avoid copyright problems.
