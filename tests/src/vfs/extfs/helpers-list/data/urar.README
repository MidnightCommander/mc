The archive was created thus:

    echo hello > 'filename with spaces.txt'
    rar a archive.rar 'filename with spaces.txt' ...

Our 'urar' supports two listing formats: that of version 5, and that of
version 4.

'urar.v5.input' was created with "unrar vt -c- -cfg- archive.rar" using
unrar 5.30.

'urar.v4,v3.input' was created with "unrar v -c- -cfg- archive.rar" using
unrar 3.80 for DOS (google "unrar dos"), via DOSBox (and then the "\" was
changed to "/" by hand). An inspection of our urar's source code should
lead us to conclude that this format is compatible with that of version
4.
