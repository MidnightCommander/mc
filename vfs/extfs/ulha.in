# Code for mc_lha_fs_run() suggested by:
# Jan 97	Zdenek Kabelac <kabi@informatics.muni.cz>

# Tested with mc 3.5.18 and gawk 3.0.0 on Linux 2.0.0
# Tested with lha v1.01 and lharc v1.02
# Information and sources for other forms of lha/lzh appreciated

# Nota bene:
# There are several compression utilities which produce *.lha files.
# LHArc and LHa in exist several versions, and their listing output varies.
# Another variable is the architecture on which the compressed file was made.
# This program attempts to sort out the variables known to me, but it is likely
# to display an empty panel if it encounters a mystery. 
# In that case it will be useful to execute this file from the command line:
# ./lha list Mystery.lha
# to examine the output directly on the console.  The output string must be
# precisely in the format described in the README in this directory.
# Another helpful thing is to temporarily remove the redirection of error
# output of awk (The '2> /dev/null' instruction near the end of mcfs_list())
# The screen will get ugly if there's an error, but some useful text shows
# at the bottom of the screen.  
# Caveat emptor.
