Version 4.8.0-pre1

WARNING: Configuration files was moved from your $HOME/.mc directory into
XDG_CONFIG_* directories to respect FDO standard
(http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.7.html).
To get more information, see ticket #1851.

WARNING: VFS paths now handled as vfsprefix1://vfsdata/vfsprefix2://vfsdata
(see #2361). Also, 'bindings' user file was renamed to 'mc.ext', so you need
search in this file all

    Open=file.ext#vfsprefix

and replace them to

    Open=file.ext/vfsprefix://

After this you should rename your 'bindings' file to 'mc.ext'.
Old-style paths are handled just in 'Directory hotlist' dialog, but you couldn't
mix URL-like and old style path elements in one path string. Support of old-style
paths will be removed in next major release (probably in 4.9, who knows...)

WARNING: keybinding names was renamed to provide some unification (see #2511).
The correspondence of old and new keybinging names are described in doc/keybind-migration.txt
file and in doc/keybindMigration web page.

Be aware.
