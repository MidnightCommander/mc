                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

                         Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.  This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know
you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software.  If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
              DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to
any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed
as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as
to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it.  For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since
you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices.  Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from
time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If
the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are
different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.

[Warranty]
                       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will
be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General
Public License along with this program; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,
Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a
sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating
your program into proprietary programs.  If your program
is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
Library General Public License instead of this License.

(de junio de 1.991), que cubre la mayor parte del software  de
la Free Software Foundation, y muchos más programas.

Se permite la copia y distribución de copias literales de este
documento, pero no se permite su modificación.

Preámbulo

Las  licencias  que  cubren  la mayor parte del software están
diseñadas para quitarle a usted la libertad de  compartirlo  y
modificarlo.  Por el contrario, la Licencia Pública General de
GNU pretende garantizarle la libertad de compartir y modificar
software  libre,  para  asegurar que el software es libre para
todos sus usuarios. Esta Licencia Pública General se aplica  a
la mayor parte del software de la Free Software Foundation y a
cualquier otro  programa  si  sus  autores  se  comprometen  a
utilizarla.   (Existe   otro  software  de  la  Free  Software
Foundation que está cubierto por la Licencia  Pública  General
de GNU para Bibliotecas). Si quiere, también puede aplicarla a
sus propios programas.

Cuando hablamos de software  libre,  estamos  refiriéndonos  a
libertad,  no  a precio. Nuestras Licencias Públicas Generales
están diseñadas para asegurarnos de que tenga la  libertad  de
distribuir copias de software libre (y cobrar por ese servicio
si quiere), de  que  reciba  el  código  fuente  o  que  pueda
conseguirlo si lo quiere, de que pueda modificar el software o
usar fragmentos de él en nuevos programas  libres,  y  de  que
sepa que puede hacer todas estas cosas.

Para  proteger  sus derechos necesitamos algunas restricciones
que prohiban a cualquiera negarle a  usted  estos  derechos  o
pedirle  que renuncie a ellos. Estas restricciones se traducen
en ciertas obligaciones que le afectan  si  distribuye  copias
del software, o si lo modifica.

Por  ejemplo,  si distribuye copias de uno de estos programas,
sea gratuitamente, o a cambio de  una  contraprestación,  debe
dar  a  los  receptores  todos  los  derechos  que tiene. Debe
asegurarse de que ellos también reciben, o  pueden  conseguir,
el código fuente. Y debe mostrarles estas condiciones de forma
que conozcan sus derechos.

Protegemos sus derechos con la combinación de dos medidas:

1. Ponemos el software bajo copyright y

2. le ofrecemos esta licencia, que le da  permiso  legal  para
copiar, distribuir y/o modificar el software.

También, para la protección de cada autor y la nuestra propia,
queremos asegurarnos de que todo el mundo comprende que no  se
proporciona  ninguna  garantía para este software libre. Si el
software se modifica  por  cualquiera  y  éste  a  su  vez  lo
distribuye,  queremos  que  sus  receptores  sepan  que lo que
tienen no es el original,  de  forma  que  cualquier  problema
introducido por otros no afecte a la reputación de los autores
originales.

Por  último,  cualquier  programa  libre  está  constantemente
amenazado  por  patentes sobre el software. Queremos evitar el
peligro de que  los  redistribuidores  de  un  programa  libre
obtengan  patentes  por  su  cuenta,  convirtiendo de facto el
programa en propietario. Para evitar esto, hemos dejado  claro
que  cualquier  patente  debe  ser pedida para el uso libre de
cualquiera, o no ser pedida.

Los  términos  exactos  y  las  condiciones  para  la   copia,
distribución y modificación se exponen a continuación.

Términos   y   condiciones   para  la  copia,  distribución  y
modificación

1. Esta Licencia se aplica a cualquier programa u otro tipo de
trabajo  que  contenga  una  nota  colocada por el tenedor del
copyright diciendo que puede ser distribuido bajo los términos
de  esta  Licencia Pública General. En adelante, «Programa» se
referirá  a  cualquier  programa  o  trabajo  que  cumpla  esa
condición  y  «trabajo basado en el Programa» se referirá bien
al Programa o a cualquier trabajo derivado de él según la  ley
de  copyright.  Esto es, un trabajo que contenga el programa o
una porción de él, bien en forma literal o con  modificaciones
y/o  traducido  en otro lenguaje.  Por lo tanto, la traducción
está incluida sin limitaciones en el  término  «modificación».
Cada concesionario (licenciatario) será denominado «usted».

Cualquier  otra  actividad que no sea la copia, distribución o
modificación no está cubierta por esta Licencia, está fuera de
su   ámbito.   El   acto  de  ejecutar  el  Programa  no  está
restringido, y los resultados  del  Programa  están  cubiertos
únicamente  si sus contenidos constituyen un trabajo basado en
el Programa, independientemente de haberlo producido  mediante
la  ejecución  del programa. El que esto se cumpla, depende de
lo que haga el programa.

2. Usted puede copiar y distribuir copias literales del código
fuente  del  Programa,  según  lo  has  recibido, en cualquier
medio, supuesto que de forma adecuada y bien visible  publique
en cada copia un anuncio de copyright adecuado y un repudio de
garantía, mantenga intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran
a  esta  Licencia y a la ausencia de garantía, y proporcione a
cualquier  otro  receptor  del  programa  una  copia  de  esta
Licencia junto con el Programa.

Puede  cobrar  un  precio por el acto físico de transferir una
copia, y puede, según su libre albedrío,  ofrecer  garantía  a
cambio de unos honorarios.

3.  Puede  modificar  su  copia  o  copias  del  Programa o de
cualquier porción de él, formando de esta  manera  un  trabajo
basado  en el Programa, y copiar y distribuir esa modificación
o  trabajo  bajo  los  términos  del  apartado  1,  antedicho,
supuesto que además cumpla las siguientes condiciones:

a.  Debe  hacer  que  los ficheros modificados lleven anuncios
prominentes indicando que  los  ha  cambiado  y  la  fecha  de
cualquier cambio.

b.  Debe hacer que cualquier trabajo que distribuya o publique
y que en todo o en parte contenga o sea derivado del  Programa
o  de  cualquier  parte de él sea licenciada como un todo, sin
carga alguna, a todas las terceras partes y bajo los  términos
de esta Licencia.

c.   Si   el   programa  modificado  lee  normalmente  órdenes
interactivamente cuando es ejecutado, debe hacer  que,  cuando
comience su ejecución para ese uso interactivo de la forma más
habitual, muestre o escriba un mensaje que incluya un  anuncio
de copyright y un anuncio de que no se ofrece ninguna garantía
(o por el contrario que sí  se  ofrece  garantía)  y  que  los
usuarios   pueden   redistribuir   el   programa   bajo  estas
condiciones, e indicando al usuario cómo ver una copia de esta
licencia.  (Excepción:  si  el  propio programa es interactivo
pero normalmente no muestra ese anuncio, no se requiere que su
trabajo basado en el Programa muestre ningún anuncio).

Estos  requisitos  se  aplican  al  trabajo modificado como un
todo. Si partes identificables de ese trabajo no son derivadas
del  Programa,  y  pueden,  razonablemente,  ser  consideradas
trabajos independientes y separados por ellos mismos, entonces
esta  Licencia  y  sus  términos  no  se aplican a esas partes
cuando sean distribuidas como trabajos separados. Pero  cuando
distribuya esas mismas secciones como partes de un todo que es
un trabajo basado en el Programa,  la  distribución  del  todo
debe  ser  según los términos de esta licencia, cuyos permisos
para otros licenciatarios se extienden al todo completo, y por
lo  tanto  a todas y cada una de sus partes, con independencia
de quién la escribió.

Por lo tanto, no es la intención  de  este  apartado  reclamar
derechos  o  desafiar  sus  derechos  sobre  trabajos escritos
totalmente por usted mismo. El intento es ejercer el derecho a
controlar  la  distribución de trabajos derivados o colectivos
basados en el Programa.

Además, el simple hecho de reunir un trabajo no basado  en  el
Programa  con  el  Programa  (o  con  un  trabajo basado en el
Programa) en un volumen de almacenamiento o  en  un  medio  de
distribución no hace que dicho trabajo entre dentro del ámbito
cubierto por esta Licencia.

4. Puede copiar y distribuir el Programa (o un trabajo  basado
en  él,  según  se  especifica  en  el apartado 2, como código
objeto o en formato  ejecutable  según  los  términos  de  los
apartados  1  y  2,  supuesto  que  además  cumpla  una de las
siguientes condiciones:

a. Acompañarlo con el código fuente completo  correspondiente,
en  formato  electrónico,  que  debe  ser distribuido según se
especifica en los apartados 1 y 2 de esta Licencia en un medio
habitualmente utilizado para el intercambio de programas, o

b.  Acompañarlo  con una oferta por escrito, válida durante al
menos tres años, de proporcionar a cualquier tercera parte una
copia  completa  en  formato  electrónico  del  código  fuente
correspondiente, a un  coste  no  mayor  que  el  de  realizar
físicamente  la  distribución del fuente, que será distribuido
bajo  las  condiciones  descritas  en  los  apartados  1  y  2
anteriores,  en  un  medio  habitualmente  utilizado  para  el
intercambio de programas, o

c. Acompañarlo con la  información  que  recibiste  ofreciendo
distribuir  el  código fuente correspondiente. (Esta opción se
permite sólo para distribución no comercial y  sólo  si  usted
recibió el programa como código objeto o en formato ejecutable
con tal oferta, de acuerdo con el apartado b anterior).

Por código fuente de un trabajo se entiende la forma preferida
del trabajo cuando se le hacen modificaciones. Para un trabajo
ejecutable, se entiende por código  fuente  completo  todo  el
código  fuente  para  todos  los  módulos  que  contiene,  más
cualquier fichero asociado de definición  de  interfaces,  más
los   guiones  utilizados  para  controlar  la  compilación  e
instalación del ejecutable. Como excepción especial el  código
fuente   distribuido   no   necesita   incluir  nada  que  sea
distribuido normalmente  (bien  como  fuente,  bien  en  forma
binaria) con los componentes principales (compilador, kernel y
similares) del  sistema  operativo  en  el  cual  funciona  el
ejecutable,  a  no  ser  que  el propio componente acompañe al
ejecutable.

Si la distribución del ejecutable o del código objeto se  hace
mediante  la  oferta  acceso para copiarlo de un cierto lugar,
entonces se considera la  oferta  de  acceso  para  copiar  el
código  fuente  del  mismo  lugar como distribución del código
fuente, incluso aunque terceras partes  no  estén  forzadas  a
copiar el fuente junto con el código objeto.

5.  No  puede  copiar, modificar, sublicenciar o distribuir el
Programa  excepto  como  prevé  expresamente  esta   Licencia.
Cualquier   intento   de   copiar,  modificar  sublicenciar  o
distribuir el Programa de otra forma es inválida, y  hará  que
cesen  automáticamente  los  derechos  que te proporciona esta
Licencia. En cualquier caso, las  partes  que  hayan  recibido
copias  o  derechos  de usted bajo esta Licencia no cesarán en
sus derechos mientras esas partes continúen cumpliéndola.

6. No está obligado a aceptar esta licencia, ya que no  la  ha
firmado.   Sin  embargo,  no  hay  hada más que le proporcione
permiso para modificar o distribuir el Programa o sus trabajos
derivados.  Estas  acciones  están prohibidas por la ley si no
acepta esta Licencia.  Por lo tanto, si modifica o  distribuye
el  Programa (o cualquier trabajo basado en el Programa), está
indicando que acepta esta Licencia para poder hacerlo, y todos
sus términos y condiciones para copiar, distribuir o modificar
el Programa o trabajos basados en él.

7. Cada vez que redistribuya el Programa (o cualquier  trabajo
basado en el Programa), el receptor recibe automáticamente una
licencia del licenciatario original para copiar, distribuir  o
modificar  el  Programa,  de  forma  sujeta a estos términos y
condiciones. No puede imponer al receptor ninguna  restricción
más  sobre  el ejercicio de los derechos aquí garantizados. No
es usted  responsable  de  hacer  cumplir  esta  licencia  por
terceras partes.

8.  Si  como  consecuencia de una resolución judicial o de una
alegación de infracción de patente o por cualquier otra  razón
(no  limitada  a  asuntos  relacionados  con  patentes)  se le
imponen condiciones (ya sea por mandato judicial, por  acuerdo
o por cualquier otra causa) que contradigan las condiciones de
esta Licencia, ello no le exime de cumplir las condiciones  de
esta  Licencia.  Si  no puede realizar distribuciones de forma
que se satisfagan simultáneamente sus obligaciones  bajo  esta
licencia y cualquier otra obligación pertinente entonces, como
consecuencia, no  puede  distribuir  el  Programa  de  ninguna
forma.   Por   ejemplo,   si   una   patente   no  permite  la
redistribución libre de derechos de  autor  del  Programa  por
parte   de   todos  aquellos  que  reciban  copias  directa  o
indirectamente a través de usted, entonces la única  forma  en
que  podría  satisfacer tanto esa condición como esta Licencia
sería evitar completamente la distribución del Programa.

Si cualquier porción de este apartado se considera inválida  o
imposible  de  cumplir bajo cualquier circunstancia particular
ha de cumplirse el  resto  y  la  sección  por  entero  ha  de
cumplirse en cualquier otra circunstancia.

No  es  el  propósito  de  este apartado inducirle a infringir
ninguna reivindicación de patente ni de ningún otro derecho de
propiedad   o   impugnar  la  validez  de  ninguna  de  dichas
reivindicaciones. Este apartado tiene el  único  propósito  de
proteger la integridad del sistema de distribución de software
libre, que se realiza mediante prácticas de licencia  pública.
Mucha  gente  ha  hecho  contribuciones  generosas  a  la gran
variedad de software distribuido mediante ese sistema  con  la
confianza de que el sistema se aplicará consistentemente. Será
el autor/donante quien decida si  quiere  distribuir  software
mediante  cualquier  otro  sistema  y  una  licencia  no puede
imponer esa elección.

Este apartado pretende dejar completamente  claro  lo  que  se
cree que es una consecuencia del resto de esta Licencia.

9.  Si la distribución y/o uso de el Programa está restringida
en ciertos países, bien por patentes  o  por  interfaces  bajo
copyright,  el  tenedor del copyright que coloca este Programa
bajo esta Licencia puede añadir una  limitación  explícita  de
distribución  geográfica  excluyendo esos países, de forma que
la distribución se permita sólo  en  o  entre  los  países  no
excluidos   de   esta  manera.  En  ese  caso,  esta  Licencia
incorporará la limitación como  si  estuviese  escrita  en  el
cuerpo de esta Licencia.

10.  La  Free  Software  Foundation  puede  publicar versiones
revisadas y/o nuevas de la Licencia Pública General de  tiempo
en tiempo. Dichas nuevas versiones serán similares en espíritu
a la presente versión, pero pueden ser diferentes en  detalles
para considerar nuevos problemas o situaciones.

Cada  versión  recibe un número de versión que la distingue de
otras. Si el Programa especifica un número de versión de  esta
Licencia  que  se  refiere  a  ella  y  a  «cualquier  versión
posterior»,  tienes  la  opción  de  seguir  los  términos   y
condiciones,  bien  de  esa versión, bien de cualquier versión
posterior publicada por la Free  Software  Foundation.  Si  el
Programa  no especifica un número de versión de esta Licencia,
puedes  escoger  cualquier  versión  publicada  por  la   Free
Software Foundation.

11.   Si  quiere  incorporar  partes  del  Programa  en  otros
programas  libres  cuyas  condiciones  de   distribución   son
diferentes,  escribe  al  autor  para  pedirle  permiso. Si el
software tiene  copyright  de  la  Free  Software  Foundation,
escribe  a  la Free Software Foundation: algunas veces hacemos
excepciones en estos casos. Nuestra decisión estará guiada por
el  doble  objetivo  de  de preservar la libertad de todos los
derivados de nuestro software  libre  y  promover  el  que  se
comparta y reutilice el software en general.

AUSENCIA DE GARANTÍA

12. Como el programa se licencia libre de cargas, no se ofrece
ninguna garantía sobre el  programa,  en  todas  la  extensión
permitida  por  la  legislación  aplicable.  Excepto cuando se
indique de otra forma por escrito, los tenedores del copyright
y/u  otras  partes  proporcionan  el  programa «tal cual», sin
garantía de ninguna  clase,  bien  expresa  o  implícita,  con
inclusión,  pero  sin  limitación  a las garantías mercantiles
implícitas o a la conveniencia para un  propósito  particular.
Cualquier  riesgo  referente  a  la calidad y prestaciones del
programa es asumido por usted. Si se probase que  el  Programa
es   defectuoso,   asume   el  coste  de  cualquier  servicio,
reparación o corrección.

13. En ningún caso,  salvo  que  lo  requiera  la  legislación
aplicable o haya sido acordado por escrito, ningún tenedor del
copyright ni ninguna otra parte que modifique y/o redistribuya
el Programa según se permite en esta Licencia será responsable
ante usted  por  daños,  incluyendo  cualquier  daño  general,
especial,  incidental  o  resultante producido por el uso o la
imposibilidad de uso del Programa  (con  inclusión,  pero  sin
limitación  a la pérdida de datos o a la generación incorrecta
de datos o a pérdidas sufridas por usted o por terceras partes
o  a  un  fallo  del  Programa al funcionar en combinación con
cualquier otro programa), incluso  si  dicho  tenedor  u  otra
parte ha sido advertido de la posibilidad de dichos daños.

FIN DE TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES

Apéndice:  Cómo aplicar estos términos a sus nuevos programas.

Si usted desarrolla un nuevo Programa, y quiere  que  sea  del
mayor  uso  posible para el público en general, la mejor forma
de  conseguirlo  es  convirtiéndolo  en  software  libre   que
cualquiera pueda redistribuir y cambiar bajo estos términos.

Para  hacerlo,  añada  los siguientes anuncios al programa. Lo
más seguro es añadirlos al principio de  cada  fichero  fuente
para  transmitir  lo  más efectivamente posible la ausencia de
garantía. Además cada fichero debería tener al menos la  línea
de  «copyright»  y  un  indicador a dónde puede encontrarse el
anuncio completo.

<una línea para indicar el nombre del programa  y  una  rápida
idea de qué hace.>

Copyright (C) <año>  <nombre del autor>

Este  programa  es  software  libre.  Puede redistribuirlo y/o
modificarlo bajo los términos de la Licencia  Pública  General
de  GNU  según  es  publicada por la Free Software Foundation,
bien de la versión 2  de  dicha  Licencia  o  bien  (según  su
elección) de cualquier versión posterior.

Este  programa se distribuye con la esperanza de que sea útil,
pero SIN NINGUNA GARANTÍA, incluso sin la  garantía  MERCANTIL
implícita  o  sin garantizar la CONVENIENCIA PARA UN PROPÓSITO
PARTICULAR. Véase la Licencia Pública General de GNU para  más
detalles.

Debería  haber  recibido  una  copia  de  la  Licencia Pública
General junto con este programa. Si no ha sido así, escriba  a
la Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.  Añada también información  sobre
cómo contactar con usted mediante correo electrónico y postal.

Si el programa es interactivo, haga  que  muestre  un  pequeño
anuncio como el siguiente, cuando comienza a funcionar en modo
interactivo:

Gnomovision versión 69, Copyright (C) año   nombre  del  autor
Gnomovision no ofrece ABSOLUTAMENTE NINGUNA GARANTÍA. Para más
detalles escriba «show w».

Los comandos hipotéticos «show w» y «show c» deberían  mostrar
las  partes  adecuadas  de  la  Licencia  Pública General. Por
supuesto, los comandos que use pueden  llamarse  de  cualquier
otra  manera.  Podrían  incluso  ser  pulsaciones  del ratón o
elementos de un menú (lo que sea apropiado para su  programa).

También  debería  conseguir  que su empleador (si trabaja como
programador) o su  Universidad  (si  es  el  caso)  firme  una
«renuncia  de  copyright» para el programa, si es necesario. A
continuación se ofrece un ejemplo, altere  los  nombres  según
sea conveniente:

Yoyodyne,  Inc.  mediante  este documento renuncia a cualquier
interés de derechos de  copyright  con  respecto  al  programa
Gnomovision (que hace pasadas a compiladores) escrito por Pepe
Programador.

<firma de Pepito Grillo>,  20  de  diciembre  de  1996  Pepito
Grillo, Presidente de Asuntillos Varios.

Esta  Licencia  Pública  General  no  permite  que incluya sus
programas en programas propietarios. Si  su  programa  es  una
biblioteca   de  subrutinas,  puede  considerar  más  útil  el
permitir el  enlazado  de  aplicaciones  propietarias  con  la
biblioteca.  Si  este  es  el  caso,  use  la Licencia Pública
General de GNU para Bibliotecas en lugar de esta Licencia.
