                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

                         Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.  This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know
you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software.  If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
              DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to
any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed
as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as
to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it.  For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since
you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices.  Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from
time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If
the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are
different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.

[Warranty]
                       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will
be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General
Public License along with this program; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a
sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating
your program into proprietary programs.  If your program
is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
Library General Public License instead of this License.

Всем разрешается копировать и распространять дословные копии
этого лицензионного документа, но изменять его нельзя.

Преамбула

Лицензии на большую часть программного обеспечения (ПО) сос-
тавлены так, чтобы лишить вас свободы совместно использовать
и изменять его. Напротив, Универсальная Общественная Лицензия
GNU предназначена гарантировать вашу свободу совместно ис-
пользовать и изменять свободное ПО, т.е. удостоверить, что ПО
является свободным для всех его пользователей. Эта Универ-
сальная Общественная Лицензия применима к большей части ПО
Фонда Свободного ПО и ко всем другим программам, чьи авторы
принимают на себя обязательства ее использовать. (Вместо нее
для части ПО Фонда Свободного ПО применяется Универсальная
Общественная Лицензия GNU для библиотек.) Вы тоже можете
использовать ее для своих программ.

Когда мы говорим о свободном ПО, мы имеем в виду свободу, а
не цену. Предполагается, что наши Универсальные Общественные
Лицензии гарантируют, что вы пользуетесь свободой распростра-
нять копии свободного ПО (и получать за это вознаграждение,
если вы того желаете); что вы получаете исходный код или
можете получить его, если захотите; что вы можете изменять
ПО или использовать его части в новых свободных программах;
и что вы знаете, что вы можете все это делать.

Чтобы защитить ваши права, нам нужно ввести такие ограниче-
ния, которые запретят кому бы то ни было отказывать вам в
этих правах или потребовать от вас отказаться от этих прав.
Эти ограничения переводятся в некоторые обязательства для
вас, если вы распространяете копии ПО или если вы модифици-
руете его.

Например, если вы распространяете копии такой программы
бесплатно или за вознаграждение, вы должны предоставить
получателям все права, которыми вы обладаете. Вы должны
гарантировать, что они тоже получат или смогут получить
исходный код. И вы должны показать им эти условия, чтобы
они знали о своих правах.

Мы защищаем ваши права в два этапа: (1) сохраняем авторские
права на ПО и (2) предлагаем вам эту лицензию, которая дает
вам законное право копировать, распространять и/или модифи-
цировать ПО.

Также, чтобы защитить нас и каждого автора, мы хотим удосто-
вериться, что все понимают, что гарантий на это свободное ПО
нет. Если ПО модифицируется и передается кем-то еще, мы
хотим, чтобы получатели ПО знали, что то, что у них есть --
это не оригинал, чтобы любые проблемы, созданные другими, не
отразились на репутации первоначальных авторов.

И наконец, каждой свободной программе постоянно угрожают па-
тенты на ПО. Мы хотим избежать опасности, что повторные рас-
пространители свободной программы самостоятельно получат па-
тенты, делая программу таким образом частной собственностью.
Чтобы предотвратить это, мы явно заявляем, что любой патент
должен быть либо предоставлен всем для свободного использо-
вания, либо не предоставлен никому.

Ниже следуют точные определения и условия для копирования,
распространения и модификации.

ОПРЕДЕЛЕНИЯ И УСЛОВИЯ ДЛЯ КОПИРОВАНИЯ, РАСПРОСТРАНЕНИЯ И
МОДИФИКАЦИИ

 1. Эта Лицензия применима к любой программе или другому
    произведению, содержащему уведомление, помещенное держа-
    телем авторских прав и сообщающее о том, что оно может
    распространяться при условиях, оговоренных в данной Уни-
    версальной Общественной Лицензии. В последующем термин
    "Программа" относится к любой такой программе или произ-
    ведению, а термин "произведение, основанное на Программе"
    означает Программу или любое произведение, содержащее
    Программу или ее часть, дословную, или модифицированную,
    и/или переведенную на другой язык. (Здесь и далее перевод
    включается без ограничений в понятие "модификация".)
    Каждый обладатель лицензии адресуется как "вы". Виды дея-
    тельности, не являющиеся копированием, распространением
    или модификацией не охватываются этой Лицензией; они за
    пределами ее влияния. Использование Программы по ее функ-
    циональному назначению не ограничено, и выходные данные
    Программы охватываются этой Лицензией, только если их со-
    держание является произведением, основанным на Программе
    (вне зависимости от того, были ли они получены в процессе
    использования Программы). Являются ли они таковыми, зави-
    сит от того, что именно делает Программа.
 2. Вы можете копировать и распространять дословные копии ис-
    ходного кода Программы по его получении на любом носите-
    ле, при условии что вы соответствующим образом помещаете
    на видном месте в каждой копии соответствующее уведомле-
    ние об авторских правах и отказ от гарантий; оставляете
    нетронутыми все уведомления, относящиеся к данной Лицен-
    зии и к отсутствию каких-либо гарантий; и передаете всем
    другим получателям Программы копию данной Лицензии вместе
    с Программой. Вы можете назначить плату за физический акт
    передачи копии и можете по своему усмотрению предостав-
    лять гарантии за вознаграждение.
 3. Вы можете изменять свою копию или копии Программы или
    любой ее части, создавая таким образом произведение, ос-
    нованное на Программе, и копировать и распространять эти
    модификации или произведение в соответствии с Разделом 1,
    приведенным выше, при условии, что вы выполните все ниже-
    следующие условия:
      1. Вы обязаны снабдить модифицированные файлы заметными
         уведомлениями, содержащими указания на то, что вы
         изменили файлы, и дату каждого изменения.
      2. Вы обязаны предоставить всем третьим лицам лицензию
         на бесплатное использование каждого произведения,
         которое вы распространяете или публикуете, целиком,
         и которое полностью или частично содержит Программу
         или какую-либо ее часть, на условиях, оговоренных в
         данной Лицензии.
      3. Если модифицированная программа обычно читает коман-
         ды в интерактивном режиме работы, вы должны сделать
         так, чтобы при запуске для работы в таком интер-
         активном режиме обычным для нее способом она печа-
         тала или выводила на экран объявление, содержащее
         соответствующее уведомление об авторских правах и
         уведомление о том, что гарантий нет (или, наоборот,
         сообщающее о том, что вы обеспечиваете гарантии), и
         что пользователи могут повторно распространять про-
         грамму при этих условиях, и указывающее пользовате-
         лю, как просмотреть копию данной Лицензии.
          (Исключение: если сама Программа работает в интер-
           активном режиме, но обычно не выводит подобное
           объявление, то ваше произведение, основанное на
           Программе, не обязано выводить объявление.)
    Эти требования применяются к модифицированному произве-
    дению в целом. Если известные части этого произведения
    не были основаны на Программе и могут обоснованно счи-
    таться независимыми и самостоятельными произведениями,
    то эта Лицензия и ее условия не распространяются на эти
    части, если вы распространяете их как отдельные произве-
    дения. Но если вы распространяете эти части как часть
    целого произведения, основанного на Программе, то вы
    обязаны делать это в соответствии с условиями данной Ли-
    цензии, распространяя права получателей лицензии на все
    произведение и, таким образом, на каждую часть, вне за-
    висимости от того, кто ее написал. Таким образом, содер-
    жание этого раздела не имеет цели претендовать на ваши
    права на произведение, написанное полностью вами, или
    оспаривать их; цель скорее в том, чтобы развить право
    управлять распространением производных или коллективных
    произведений, основанных на Программе. Кроме того, прос-
    тое нахождение другого произведения, не основанного на
    этой Программе, совместно с Программой (или с произведе-
    нием, основанным на этой Программе) на том же носителе
    для постоянного хранения или распространяемом носителе
    не распространяет действие этой Лицензии на другое произ-
    ведение.
 4. Вы можете копировать и распространять Программу (или
    произведение, основанное на ней) согласно Разделу 2) в
    объектном коде или в выполнимом виде в соответствии с
    Разделами 1 и 2, приведенными выше, при условии, что вы
    также выполните одно из следующих требований:
      1. Сопроводите ее полным соответствующим машиночитаемым
         исходным кодом, который должен распространяться в
         соответствии с Разделами 1 и 2, приведенными выше,
         на носителе, обычно используемом для обмена ПО; или,
      2. Сопроводите ее письменным предложением, действитель-
         ным по крайней мере в течение трех лет, предоставить
         любому третьему лицу за вознаграждение не большее
         стоимости физического акта изготовления копии полную
         машиночитаемую копию соответствующего исходного
         кода, подлежащую распространению в соответствии с
         Разделами 1 и 2, приведенными выше; или
      3. Сопроводите ее информацией, полученной вами в ка-
         честве предложения распространить соответствующий
         исходный код. (Эта возможность допустима только для
         некоммерческого распространения, и только если вы
         получили программу в объектном коде или в выполнимом
         виде с предложением в соответствии с Пунктом b)
         выше.)
    Исходный код для произведения означает его вид, пред-
    почтительный для  выполнения в нем модификаций. Для ис-
    полняемого произведения полный исходный код означает все
    исходные коды для всех модулей, которые он содержит, плюс
    любые связанные с произведением файлы определения
    интерфейса, плюс сценарии, используемые для управления
    компиляцией и установкой исполняемого произведения.
    Однако, в виде особого исключения распространяемый исход-
    ный код не обязан включать то, что обычно предоставляется
    с основными компонентами операционной системы, под
    управлением которой работает исполняемое произведение, за
    исключением случая, когда сам компонент сопровождает
    исполняемое произведение. Если распространение исполня-
    емого произведения или объектного кода происходит путем
    предоставления доступа для копирования с обозначенного
    места, то предоставление доступа для копирования исходно-
    го кода с того же места считается распространением исход-
    ного кода, даже если третьи лица не принуждаются к копи-
    рованию исходного кода вместе с объектным кодом.
 5. Вы не можете копировать, изменять, повторно лицензиро-
    вать, или распространять Программу иначе, чем это явно
    предусмотрено данной Лицензией. Любая попытка копировать,
    изменять, повторно лицензировать, или распространять Про-
    грамму каким-либо другим способом неправомерна и автома-
    тически прекращает ваши права данные вам этой Лицензией.
    Однако лицензии лиц, получивших от вас копии или права
    согласно данной Универсальной Общественной Лицензии, не
    прекратят своего действия до тех пор, пока эти лица пол-
    ностью соблюдают условия.
 6. Вы не обязаны соглашаться с этой Лицензией, так как вы
    не подписывали ее. Однако тогда вы не получаете права
    модифицировать или распространять Программу или основан-
    ные на Программе произведения. Эти действия запрещены
    законом, если вы не принимаете к соблюдению эту Лицензию.
    А значит, изменяя или распространяя Программу (или
    произведение, основанное на Программе), вы изъявляете
    свое согласие с этой Лицензией и всеми ее условиями о
    копировании, распространении или модификации Программы
    или произведений, основанных на ней.
 7. Каждый раз, когда вы повторно распространяете Программу
    (или любое произведение, основанное на Программе), полу-
    чатель этого произведения автоматически получает лицензию
    от первоначального держателя лицензии на копирование,
    распространение или модификацию Программы, обсуждаемую
    в этих определениях и условиях. Вы не можете налагать
    каких-либо дополнительных ограничений на осуществление
    получателем прав, предоставленных данным документом. Вы
    не несете ответственности за соблюдение третьими лицами
    условий этой Лицензии.
 8. Если в результате судебного разбирательства, или обвине-
    ния в нарушении патента или по любой другой причине (не
    обязательно связанной с патентами), вам навязаны условия,
    противоречащие данной Лицензии (как по решению суда, так
    и нет), то это не освобождает вас от соблюдения Лицензии.
    Если вы не можете заниматься распространением так, чтобы
    одновременно удовлетворить требованиям и этой Лицензии,
    и всем другим требованиям, то вы не должны заниматься
    распространением Программы.
    Например, если патент не позволяет безвозмездное повтор-
    ное распространение Программы всем, кто получил копии от
    вас непосредственно или через посредников, то единствен-
    ным способом удовлетворить и патенту, и этой Лицензии
    будет ваш полный отказ от распространения Программы. Если
    какая-либо часть этого раздела не имеет силы или не может
    быть применена при любых конкретных обстоятельствах, то
    подразумевается, что имеет силу остальная часть раздела,
    и весь Раздел имеет силу при других обстоятельствах. Цель
    этого раздела -- не побудить вас делать заявления о нару-
    шениях прав на патент, или заявлять о других претензиях
    на право собственности, или оспаривать правильность по-
    добных претензий; единственная цель этого раздела -- за-
    щита целостности системы распространения свободного ПО,
    которая реализуется использованием общих лицензий. Многие
    люди благодаря этой системе внесли щедрый вклад в широкий
    спектр распространяемого ПО полагаясь на согласованное
    применение этой системы; автору принадлежит право решать
    хочет ли он или она распространять ПО в этой системе или
    в какой-то другой, и получатель лицензии не может влиять
    на принятие этого решения. Этот раздел предназначен для
    того, чтобы тщательно прояснить, что полагается следстви-
    ем из остальной части данной Лицензии.
 9. Если распространение и/или применение Программы ограниче-
    но в ряде стран либо патентами, либо авторскими правами
    на интерфейсы, первоначальный обладатель авторских прав,
    выпускающий Программу с этой Лицензией, может добавить
    явное ограничение на географическое распространение,
    исключив такие страны, так что распространение разреша-
    ется только в тех странах, которые не были исключены. В
    этом случае данная Лицензия включает в себя это ограниче-
    ние, как если бы оно было написано в тексте данной Лицен-
    зии.
10. Фонд Свободного ПО может время от времени публиковать
    пересмотренные и/или новые версии Универсальной Общест-
    венной Лицензии. Такие новые версии будут сходны по духу
    с настоящей версией, но могут отличаться в деталях,
    направленных на новые проблемы или обстоятельства. Каждой
    версии придается отличительный номер версии. Если в Про-
    грамме указан номер версии данной Лицензии, которая к ней
    применима, и слова "любая последующая версия", вы можете
    по выбору следовать определениям и условиям либо данной
    версии, либо любой последующей версии, опубликованной
    Фондом Свободного ПО. Если в Программе не указан номер
    версии данной Лицензии, вы можете выбрать любую версию,
    когда-либо опубликованную Фондом Свободного ПО.
11. Если вы хотите встроить части Программы в другие свобод-
    ные программы с иными условиями распространения, напишите
    автору с просьбой о разрешении. Для ПО, которое охраняет-
    ся авторскими правами Фонда Свободного ПО, напишите в
    Фонд Свободного ПО; мы иногда делаем исключения для
    этого. Наше решение будет руководствоваться двумя целями:
    сохранения свободного статуса всех производных нашего
    свободного ПО и содействия совместному и повторному ис-
    пользованию ПО вообще.

КОНЕЦ ОПРЕДЕЛЕНИЙ И УСЛОВИЙ

Как применять эти условия к вашим новым программам

Если вы разрабатываете новую программу и хотите, чтобы она
принесла максимально возможную пользу обществу, лучший способ
достичь этого - включить ее в свободное ПО, которое каждый
может повторно распространять и изменять согласно данным
условиям.

Чтобы сделать это, добавьте в программу следующие уведомле-
ния. Самое безопасное -- это добавить их в начало каждого
исходного файла, чтобы наиболее эффективно отобразить исклю-
чение гарантий; и каждый файл должен содержать по меньшей
мере строку, содержащую знак охраны авторского права и
указание на то, где находится полное уведомление.

одна строка, содержащая название программы и краткое
описание того, что она делает.
(C) наименование (имя) автора 19гг

Это свободная программа; вы можете повторно распространять
ее и/или модифицировать ее в соответствии с Универсальной
Общественной Лицензией GNU, опубликованной Фондом Свободного
ПО; либо версии 2, либо (по вашему выбору) любой более
поздней версии.

Эта программа распространяется в надежде, что она будет
полезной, но БЕЗ КАКИХ-ЛИБО ГАРАНТИЙ; даже без подразумевае-
мых гарантий КОММЕРЧЕСКОЙ ЦЕННОСТИ или ПРИГОДНОСТИ ДЛЯ
КОНКРЕТНОЙ ЦЕЛИ.  Для получения подробных сведений смотрите
Универсальную Общественную Лицензию GNU.

Вы должны были получить копию Универсальной Общественной
Лицензии GNU вместе с этой программой; если нет, напишите
по адресу: Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Добавьте также сведения о том, как связаться с вами по
электронной и обычной почте.

Если программа интерактивная, сделайте так, чтобы при запуске
в интерактивном режиме она выдавала краткое уведомление типа
следующего:

Gnomovision, версия 69, (C) имя автора 19гг
Gnomovision поставляется АБСОЛЮТНО БЕЗ КАКИХ-ЛИБО ГАРАНТИЙ;
для получения подробностей напечатайте 'show w'.  Это свобод-
ная программа, и вы приглашаетесь повторно распространять ее
при определенных условиях; для получения подробностей введите
'show c'.

Гипотетические команды `show w' и `show c' должны показывать
соответствующие части Универсальной Общественной Лицензии.
Конечно, используемые вами команды могут называться как-ни-
будь иначе, нежели `show w' и `show c'; они даже могут выби-
раться с помощью мыши или быть пунктами меню -- все, что
подходит для вашей программы.

Вы также должны добиться того, чтобы ваш работодатель (если
вы работаете программистом) или ваше учебное заведение, если
таковое имеется, подписали в случае необходимости "отказ от
имущественных прав" на эту программу. Вот образец; замените
фамилии:

Компания ``Братья Ёёдины'' настоящим отказывается от всех
имущественных прав на программу 'Gnomovision' (которая делает
пассы в сторону компиляторов), написанную Абстрактным К.И.

подпись Мага Ната, 1 апреля 1989 г
Маг Нат, Президент фирмы Вице.

Данная Универсальная Общественная Лицензия не позволяет вам
включать вашу программу в программы, являющиеся частной соб-
ственностью. Если ваша программа -- это библиотека процедур,
вам стоит подумать, не будет ли лучше разрешить программам,
являющимся частной собственностью, связываться с вашей
библиотекой. Если это то, чего вы хотите, используйте вместо
этой Лицензии Универсальную Общественную Лицензию GNU для
библиотек.

[QueryBox]
Диалоговые окна запросов

В окнах запросов для выбора какого-либо варианта ответа
(которые обычно задаются в виде экранных кнопок) Вы можете
использовать либо клавиши со стрелками, либо выбрать ответ
путем нажатия клавиши с выделенной в названии кнопки
буквой, либо щелкнув по нужной кнопке мышкой.


[How to use help]
Как пользоваться помощью

При работе с программой Midnight Commander практически в
любой момент можно обратиться к интерактивной подсказке,
вызов которой осуществляется нажатием клавиши F1. Для
перемещения в окне просмотра подсказки Вы можете
использовать клавиши перемещения курсора (стрелки) или
мышь. Стрелка вниз вызывает переход к следующей ссылке
(выделены голубым фоном) или сдвиг текста на одну строку
вверх. Стрелка вверх вызывает переход к предыдущей ссылке
или сдвиг текста на одну строку вверх. Стрелка вправо
вызывает переход по ссылке, которая в данный момент
выделена синим фоном (текущая ссылка). По стрелке влево
происходит переход к ранее просмотренным разделам
подсказки.

Если Ваш терминал не поддерживает клавиши-стрелки, Вы
можете использовать клавишу пробела для перехода к
следующей странице подсказки и клавишу 'b' для перехода к
предыдущей странице. Клавиша TAB вызывает переход к
следующей ссылке, а нажатие ENTER - переход по текущей
ссылке. При просмотре подсказки программа запоминает
последовательность переходов по ссылкам и позволяет
вернуться к ранее просмотренным разделам, воспользовавшись
клавишей 'l' (last). Нажатие на ESC вызывает выход из окна
подсказки.

По щелчку левой клавиши мыши происходит переход по ссылке
или перемещение по тексту подсказки. Щелчок правой кнопкой
мыши используется для переход к ранее просмотренным
разделам.
