# This skin demonstrates how to use 256 colors in mc.
#
# As a prerequisite, you will need to:
#   1) Have a terminal emulator that supports 256 colors (a few examples:
#      xterm, Gnome terminal and other VTE derivatives, KDE's Konsole;
#      iTerm for Mac OS X, PuTTY for Windows).
#   2) Adjust your TERM variable accordingly, e.g.: export TERM=xterm-256color
#      Verify by running tput colors
#
# Each of the 256 colors has two names, you can use whichever you prefer.
#
# One possibility is to use the names "color0" to "color255" to access every
# color directly based on their number.
#
# The first 16 colors ("color0" to "color15") can also be specified by their
# names (these names are already being used by mc for 8/16 color terminals):
#   black      gray
#   red        brightred
#   green      brightgreen
#   brown      yellow
#   blue       brightblue
#   magenta    brightmagenta
#   cyan       brightcyan
#   lightgray  white
# Note that with 8/16 color terminal settings (such as TERM=xterm), colors
# of the second column can only be used for the foreground, and their actual
# interpretation varies across terminals. Some terminals show the colors
# from the first column instead (that is, you only have 8 colors), but make
# them bold. Others show the brighter version (16 foreground colors). Yet
# others make them bold and bright at the same time. Switching to 256 colors
# should end this ambiguity: you should have 16 separate colors according to
# their names, none of them are bold by default but any of them can be
# switched to bold, and all of them are available for background, too. This
# is the intended behavior, the actual behavior might vary across terminals.
#
# Colors of the 6x6x6 cube ("color16" to "color231") can alternatively be
# referred to as "rgb000" to "rgb555", all three digits ranging from 0 to 5,
# corresponding to the R, G and B color components.
#
# The 24 grayscale colors ("color232" to "color255") have the aliases "gray0"
# to "gray23".
#
# In addition to the 256 colors, the special word "default" means the
# default foreground or background color of your terminal, while "base" means
# mc's main colors. A missing value means falling back to the _default_ of the
# given section.
#
# Following the foreground and background colors, the third (optional) value
# can specify special attributes to enable. Valid values are bold, underline,
# italic, reverse and blink. Append more with a plus sign, e.g. "bold+italic".
# Leaving the field empty makes it fall back to the attributes of _default_.
# Use any other word (e.g. "none") to prevent fallback and disable all flags.
#
# Italic support requires a recent enough ncurses (>= 5.9.20130831) or slang
# (>= 2.3). All attributes are subject to support by the terminal emulator.
