The input files were created thus:

    cd ~/.gimp-2.8
    echo hello > 'filename with spaces.txt'
    echo hello > ' filename with leading space.txt'
    echo hello > '-filename with leading dash.txt'
    zip a.zip *
    unzip -Z -l -T a.zip > uzip.with-zipinfo.input
    unzip -qq -v a.zip > uzip.without-zipinfo--ymd.input
    rm a.zip

uzip supports two date formats for "without-zipinfo" mode: ymd
(YYYY-MM-DD) and mdy (MM-DD-YY). To create the
'uzip.without-zipinfo--mdy.input' file, with MM-DD-YY dates, I simply
altered two dates with an editor (one with year before 70, one after).
