                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

                         Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.  This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know
you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software.  If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
              DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to
any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed
as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as
to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it.  For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since
you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices.  Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from
time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If
the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are
different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.

[Warranty]
                       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will
be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General
Public License along with this program; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,
Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a
sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating
your program into proprietary programs.  If your program
is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
Library General Public License instead of this License.

           Powszechna Licencja Publiczna GNU
                Wersja 2, czerwiec 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

  Zezwala siê na kopiowanie i rozpowszechnianie wiernych
kopii niniejszego dokumentu licencyjnego, jednak bez prawa
wprowadzania zmian. 

                     Preambu³a

  Wiêkszo¶æ licencji na oprogramowanie pomy¶lana jest po
to, aby odebraæ u¿ytkownikowi mo¿liwo¶æ swobodnego
udostêpniania innym i zmieniania danego software'u.
Natomiast w wypadku Powszechnej Licencji Publicznej GNU
(GNU General Public License, GPL) celem jest
zagwarantowanie u¿ytkownikowi swobody udostêpniania i
zmieniania tego bezp³atnego oprogramowania, a wiêc danie
pewno¶ci, i¿ oprogramowanie jest wolno dostêpne dla
wszystkich u¿ytkowników. Niniejsza Powszechna Licencja
Publiczna dotyczy wiêkszo¶ci oprogramowania wydawanego
przez Fundacjê Wolnego Oprogramowania (Free Software
Foundation) oraz wszelkich innych programów, których
autorzy zobowi±zuj± siê do jej stosowania. (Niektóre
rodzaje oprogramowania wydawanego przez Fundacjê objête s±
Powszechn± Licencj± Publiczn± GNU dla Bibliotek, GNU
Library General Public License). U¿ytkownik mo¿e stosowaæ
j± równie¿ do swoich programów.

  Mówi±c o wolnym oprogramowaniu mamy na my¶li swobodê, a
nie cenê. Nasze Powszechne Licencje Publiczne wprowadzono
po to, aby zapewniæ Pañstwu swobodê rozpowszechniania
kopii tego oprogramowania (i - je¶li kto¶ chce -
pobierania za tê us³ugê op³aty), jak równie¿ aby
udostêpniæ kod ¼ród³owy oraz umo¿liwiæ dokonywanie zmian
tego oprogramowania lub wykorzystywania jego fragmentów w
nowych, wolnych programach. Nie bez znaczenia jest te¿
sama mo¿liwo¶æ dotarcia do Pañstwa z informacj± o
wszystkich tych udogodnieniach.

  W celu ochrony praw u¿ytkownika jeste¶my zmuszeni
wprowadzaæ ograniczenia zabraniaj±ce komukolwiek
kwestionowanie jego praw albo sugerowanie rezygnacji z
tych praw. Ograniczenia te sprowadzaj± siê do pewnych dla
Pañstwa obowi±zków w przypadku rozpowszechniania przez Was
kopii naszego oprogramowania b±d¼ dokonywania w nim zmian.

  Na przyk³ad, je¶li rozprowadzacie Pañstwo kopie takiego
programu, niezale¿nie czy gratisowo, czy za op³at±,
musicie Pañstwo odbiorcy udzieliæ wszelkich tych praw,
jakie mieli¶cie sami. Musicie zapewniæ mu równie¿
otrzymanie kodu ¼ród³owego (lub mo¿liwo¶æ otrzymania) oraz
przedstawiæ niniejsze Warunki, aby móg³ on poznaæ swoje
prawa.

  Ochrona Pañstwa praw przebiega w dwóch etapach:

  1. zastrzegamy prawo w³asno¶ci autorskiej do
oprogramowania,
  
  2. oferujemy Pañstwu niniejsz± licencjê, która daje Wam
sankcjonowane prawem zezwolenie na kopiowanie,
rozpowszechnianie i/lub modyfikowanie tego oprogramowania.

  Ponadto dla ochrony tak autora, jak i naszej, pragniemy
mieæ pewno¶æ, ¿e ka¿dy zrozumie, i¿ na niniejsze wolne
oprogramowanie nie udziela siê gwarancji. W razie
dokonania w nim przez kogo¶ modyfikacji i puszczenia dalej
do obrotu, pragniemy, aby dalsi odbiorcy zdawali sobie
sprawê z tego, ¿e problemy wprowadzone przez inne osoby
nie s± wyrazem oryginalnych dzia³añ twórców.

  I rzecz ostatnia: ka¿demu wolnemu programowi stale
zagra¿aj± patenty na oprogramowanie. Naszym pragnieniem
jest unikanie takiego niebezpieczeñstwa, kiedy
redystrybutorzy wolnego programu indywidualnie uzyskuj±
prawa patentowe, nadaj±c tym samym programowi charakter
prawnie zastrze¿ony. W celu zapobie¿enia takim zjawiskom
jednoznacznie wyja¶nili¶my, ¿e ka¿dy patent musi byæ
wydawany albo dla swobodnego u¿ytku przez wszystkich, albo
nie wydawany wcale.

  Poni¿ej podajemy dok³adne zasady i warunki kopiowania,
rozpowszechniania i modyfikowania.


            ZASADY I WARUNKI KOPIOWANIA,
          ROZPOWSZECHNIANIA I MODYFIKOWANIA

  0. Niniejsza Licencja dotyczy programów i innych prac,
na których umieszczona jest pochodz±ca od w³a¶ciciela praw
autorskich informacja, ¿e dany program lub praca mo¿e byæ
rozpowszechniana na warunkach niniejszej Powszechnej
Licencji Publicznej. U¿ywane poni¿ej s³owo "Program"
oznacza w³a¶nie takie programy lub prace, za¶ okre¶lenie
"praca oparta na Programie" dotyczy albo Programu, albo
pochodz±cej od niego pracy w rozumieniu prawa autorskiego,
to jest pracy zawieraj±cej Program lub jego czê¶æ
dos³own±, b±d¼ zmodyfikowan± i/lub prze³o¿on± na inny
jêzyk. (W dalszym ci±gu niniejszego, pojêcie przek³adu
w³±cza siê bez ograniczeñ do terminu "modyfikacja"). Do
ka¿dego licencjobiorcy bêdziemy zwracaæ siê "per Ty".

  Niniejsza Licencja nie obejmuje dzia³añ innych ni¿
kopiowanie, rozprowadzanie i modyfikowanie - nie mieszcz±
siê one w jej zakresie. Czynno¶æ u¿ywania Programu nie
jest poddana ograniczeniom, a produkty uzyskane z Programu
objête s± Licencj± tylko wtedy, gdy ich tre¶æ stanowi
pracê opart± na Programie (niezale¿nie od stworzenia jej
przy u¿yciu Programu). To, czy fakt taki jest prawd±,
zale¿y od tego, co dany Program wykonuje.

  1. Mo¿esz kopiowaæ i rozprowadzaæ w dowolnych mediach
wierne kopie kodu ¼ród³owego Programu w otrzymanej formie
pod warunkiem, ¿e w widoczny sposób i odpowiednio podasz
na ka¿dej kopii w³a¶ciw± informacjê o prawie autorskim i
zrzeczenie siê uprawnieñ z tytu³u gwarancji; wszelkie
napisy informacyjne na temat Licencji i faktu
nieudzielania gwarancji musisz chroniæ przed uszkodzeniem,
za¶ wszystkim innym odbiorcom Programu musisz wraz z
Programem wrêczaæ egzemplarz niniejszej Licencji. 

  Mo¿esz pobieraæ op³atê za fizyczn± czynno¶æ przekazania
kopii i wed³ug w³asnej decyzji mo¿esz za op³at± proponowaæ
ochronê gwarancyjn±.

  2. Mo¿esz modyfikowaæ swoj± kopiê czy kopie Programu
oraz dowolne jego czê¶ci, tworz±c przez to pracê opart± na
Programie, jak równie¿ kopiowaæ i rozprowadzaæ takie
modyfikacje i pracê na warunkach podanych w pkt.1 powy¿ej
- pod warunkiem przestrzegania ca³o¶ci poni¿szych wymogów:

    a) Musisz spowodowaæ umieszczenie na zmodyfikowanych
plikach widocznej informacji o tym, ¿e dane pliki zosta³y
przez ciebie zmienione, wraz z dat± dokonania zmian.

    b) Musisz doprowadziæ do tego, aby ka¿da
rozpowszechniana lub publikowana przez ciebie praca, która
w ca³o¶ci lub czê¶ci zawiera Program, albo pochodzi od
niego lub jego czê¶ci, by³a w ca³o¶ci i bezp³atnie
licencjonowana dla wszelkich stron trzecich na warunkach
niniejszej Licencji.

    c) Je¿eli zmodyfikowany program podczas korzystania z
niego w normalnym trybie odczytuje polecenia
interaktywnie, musisz spowodowaæ, aby po uruchomieniu
(u¿yty w interaktywny sposób w najzwyklejszym trybie),
wydrukowywa³ on lub wy¶wietla³ powiadomienie o odno¶nym
prawie autorskim i braku gwarancji (ewentualnie o
zapewnianiu gwarancji przez ciebie), oraz o tym, ¿e
u¿ytkownicy mog± redystrybuowaæ ten program na niniejszych
warunkach wraz z informacj±, jak u¿ytkownik mo¿e zapoznaæ
siê z tre¶ci± niniejszej Licencji. (Wyj±tek: je¶li sam
Program jest interaktywny, ale normalnie nie drukuje
takiego powiadomienia, twoja praca oparta na nim te¿ nie
musi wydrukowywaæ takiego powiadomienia).

  Niniejsze wymogi odnosz± siê do zmodyfikowanej pracy
jako ca³o¶ci. Je¶li daj±ce siê ustaliæ sekcje danej pracy
nie pochodz± od Programu i mog± byæ racjonalnie uwa¿ane za
samodzielne i odrêbne same w sobie, to niniejsza Licencja
i jej warunki nie maj± zastosowania do takich sekcji przy
rozprowadzaniu ich przez ciebie jako odrêbne prace. Je¶li
jednak rozprowadzasz je jako czê¶æ ca³o¶ci, bêd±cej prac±
opart± na Programie, rozpowszechnianie tej ca³o¶ci musi
byæ dokonywane na warunkach niniejszej Licencji, której
zezwolenia dla innych licencjobiorców rozci±gaj± siê w
ca³ej szeroko¶ci na tê ca³o¶æ, a tym samym i na ka¿d±
indywidualn± jej czê¶æ, niezale¿nie od jej autorstwa.

  Dlatego te¿ intencj± tego fragmentu nie jest roszczenie
sobie praw albo podwa¿anie twych praw do pracy napisanej w
ca³o¶ci przez ciebie. Chodzi nam raczej o korzystanie z
prawa kontrolowania dystrybucji pochodnych i zbiorowych
prac opartych na Programie. 

  I jeszcze jedno: samo tylko po³±czenie z Programem (lub
z prac± opart± na Programie) innej pracy - nie opartej na
Programie, w ramach wolumenu no¶nika przechowywania lub
dystrybucji, nie powoduje objêcia takiej pracy zakresem
niniejszej Licencji.

  3. Mo¿esz kopiowaæ i rozprowadzaæ Program (lub opart± na
nim pracê - zgodnie z pkt.2 w kodzie wynikowym lub w
formie wykonywalnej w my¶l postanowieñ pkt.1 i 2 powy¿ej,
pod warunkiem zrealizowania równie¿ poni¿szych wymogów:

    a) Musisz do³±czyæ do niego odpowiadaj±cy mu,
kompletny i mo¿liwy do odczytania przez urz±dzenia cyfrowe
kod ¼ród³owy, który musi byæ rozpowszechniany na warunkach
pkt.1 i 2 powy¿ej i na no¶niku zwyczajowo u¿ywanym dla
wzajemnej wymiany oprogramowania; lub

    b) do³±czyæ do niego pisemn± ofertê, wa¿n± co najmniej
3 lata, przyznaj±c± ka¿dej stronie trzeciej - za op³at±
nie przekraczaj±c± twego kosztu fizycznego wykonywania
dystrybucji ¼ród³a - kompletn±, odczytywaln± przez
urz±dzenia cyfrowe kopiê odpowiadaj±cego mu kodu
¼ród³owego, rozprowadzan± na warunkach pkt.1 i 2 powy¿ej,
na no¶niku zwyczajowo u¿ywanym do wzajemnej wymiany
oprogramowania; lub

     c) do³±czyæ do niego informacjê, jak± otrzyma³e¶ na
temat oferty rozprowadzania odpowiedniego kodu ¼ród³owego.
(Ta mo¿liwo¶æ dozwolona jest tylko dla dystrybucji
niehandlowej i jedynie wtedy, gdy otrzyma³e¶ dany program
w kodzie wynikowym lub formie wykonywalnej wraz z
wymienion± ofert± - zgodnie z podpunktem "b" powy¿ej).

  Okre¶lenie kod ¼ród³owy dla pracy oznacza formê pracy
preferowan± dla wprowadzania do niej modyfikacji. Dla
wykonanej pracy, kompletny kod ¼ród³owy oznacza ca³y kod
¼ród³owy wszystkich modu³ów, wszelkie sprzê¿one z ni±
po¶rednicz±ce pliki opisuj±ce oraz zbiory komend stosowane
do sterowania kompilacj± i instalowaniem programów.
Niemniej jednak, jako wyj±tek specjalny, dystrybuowany (w
formie ¼ród³owej albo binarnej) kod ¼ród³owy nie musi
obejmowaæ niczego, co jest normalnie rozprowadzane przy
pomocy g³ównych komponentów (kompilator, j±dro itd.)
systemu operacyjnego, na którym pracuje czê¶æ wykonywalna,
o ile sam taki komponent towarzyszy tej czê¶ci.

  Je¶li dystrybucja czê¶ci wykonywalnej albo kodu
wynikowego realizowana jest poprzez oferowanie dostêpu do
kopii z wyznaczonego miejsca, to oferowanie równowa¿nego
dostêpu dla kopiowania kodu ¼ród³owego z tego samego
miejsca liczy siê jako rozpowszechnianie kodu ¼ród³owego,
nawet gdy strony trzecie nie s± zmuszone do kopiowania
¼ród³a wraz z kodem wynikowym.

  4. Poza przypadkami jednoznacznie dozwolonymi w
niniejszej Licencji, nie mo¿esz kopiowaæ, modyfikowaæ,
sublicencjonowaæ ani rozpowszechniaæ Programu. We
wszystkich pozosta³ych wypadkach, ka¿da próba skopiowania,
sublicencjonowania lub rozpowszechnienia Programu jest
niewa¿na i powoduje automatyczne wyga¶niêcie twoich praw z
tytu³u Licencji. Niemniej jednak, stronom, które ju¿
otrzyma³y od ciebie kopie albo prawa w ramach niniejszej
Licencji, licencje nie wygasaj± tak d³ugo, jak d³ugo
strony te w pe³ni stosuj± siê do nich.

  5. Nie musisz akceptowaæ niniejszej Licencji, je¿eli jej
nie podpisa³e¶. Niemniej jednak, nic innego nie zapewni ci
zezwolenia na modyfikowanie lub rozprowadzanie Programu i
pochodz±cych od niego prac. Dzia³ania takie s± prawnie
zabronione, je¿eli nie przyjmujesz niniejszej Licencji.
Dlatego te¿, poprzez modyfikowanie b±d¼ rozpowszechnianie
Programu (lub pracy na nim opartej) dajesz wyraz swojej
akceptacji dla Licencji i wszelkich jej postanowieñ i
warunków dotycz±cych kopiowania, rozprowadzania i
modyfikowania Programu lub opartych na nim prac.

  6. W ka¿dym przypadku redystrybucji przez ciebie
Programu (albo opartej na nim pracy), odbiorca
automatycznie otrzymuje od pierwotnego licencjodawcy
licencjê na kopiowanie, rozpowszechnianie i modyfikowanie
Programu na niniejszych zasadach i warunkach. Na
korzystanie przez odbiorcê z udzielonych w niniejszej
Licencji praw nie mo¿esz narzucaæ ju¿ dalszych ograniczeñ.
Nie jeste¶ stron± odpowiedzialn± za kontrolê
przestrzegania Licencji przez osoby trzecie.

  7. Je¶li na skutek wyroku s±dowego lub zarzutu
naruszenia patentu, jak te¿ z ka¿dej innej przyczyny (nie
ograniczonej do kwestii patentowych) zostan± narzucone na
ciebie (niezale¿nie czy to moc± wyroku s±dowego, umowy,
czy w inny sposób) warunki sprzeczne z warunkami
niniejszej Licencji, to nie zwalniaj± one ciebie z
warunków Licencji. Je¶li nie mo¿esz prowadziæ dystrybucji
tak, aby wype³niaæ jednocze¶nie swoje obowi±zki z tytu³u
niniejszej Licencji i inne odno¶ne obowi±zki, to w
rezultacie nie mo¿esz wcale rozprowadzaæ Programu. Na
przyk³ad, gdyby licencja patentowa nie zezwala³a na woln±
od op³at licencyjnych redystrybucjê Programu przez
wszystkie osoby, które otrzyma³y kopie bezpo¶rednio lub
po¶rednio od ciebie, to jedynym sposobem pozwalaj±cym ci
na przestrzeganie i licencji patentowej, i Licencji
niniejszej, by³oby ca³kowite powstrzymanie siê od
jakiejkolwiek dystrybucji Programu.

  Je¿eli w jakich¶ szczególnych okoliczno¶ciach który¶
fragment niniejszego punktu sta³by siê niewa¿ny lub
niewykonywalny, to intencj± jest, aby znajdowa³a
zastosowanie pozosta³a czê¶æ punktu, a tre¶æ ca³ego punktu
by³a stosowana w pozosta³ych okoliczno¶ciach. 

  Celem niniejszego punktu nie jest zachêcanie do
naruszania patentów czy innych praw w³asno¶ci, albo te¿ do
podwa¿ania ich wa¿no¶ci; niniejszy punkt za swój jedyny
cel ma ochronê integralno¶ci systemu rozpowszechniania
wolnego oprogramowania, realizowanego za pomoc±
publicznych licencji. Wielu ludzi bezinteresownie wnios³o
swój wk³ad do stworzenia szerokiego zakresu oprogramowania
upowszechnianego w tym systemie, maj±c zaufanie do
konsekwentnego jego stosowania; wy³±cznie do
autora/ofiarodawcy nale¿y decyzja, czy ¿yczy on sobie
rozprowadzania oprogramowania za po¶rednictwem innego
systemu i licencjobiorca nie mo¿e tego prawa wyboru
ograniczaæ. 

  Intencj± niniejszego punktu jest jasne i wyra¼ne
przedstawienie tego, co uwa¿a siê za skutki, jakie rodzi
pozosta³a czê¶æ niniejszej Licencji.

  8. W przypadku, gdy dystrybucja i/lub u¿ywanie Programu
w niektórych krajach poddane jest ograniczeniom patentowym
lub zastrze¿eniom prawami autorskimi, pocz±tkowy posiadacz
praw autorskich, który poddaje Program pod oddzia³ywanie
niniejszej Licencji, mo¿e dodaæ wyra¼nie zakre¶lone
geograficzne ograniczenie rozpowszechniania wy³±czaj±ce te
kraje, dziêki czemu dystrybucja dozwolona bêdzie wy³±cznie
w krajach czy w¶ród krajów nie objêtych takim wy³±czeniem.
W przypadku takim, niniejsza Licencja obejmuje dane
ograniczenie tak, jakby by³o ono wpisane w jej tre¶æ.

  9. W miarê potrzeby Fundacja Wolnego Oprogramowania mo¿e
publikowaæ poprawione i/lub nowe wersje Powszechnej
Licencji Publicznej. Takie nowe wersje bêd± napisane w
duchu podobnym do obecnej wersji, ale mog± ró¿niæ siê w
szczegó³ach poruszaj±cych nowe problemy czy zagadnienia.

  Ka¿dej wersji nadaje siê wyró¿niaj±cy j± numer. Je¿eli
Program podaje numer wersji niniejszej Licencji, odnosz±cy
siê do tej wersji i "wszelkich wersji nastêpnych", masz do
wyboru albo stosowaæ siê do postanowieñ i warunków tej
wersji, albo którejkolwiek wersji pó¼niejszej wydanej
przez Fundacjê Wolnego Oprogramowania. O ile Program nie
podaje numeru wersji niniejszej Licencji, mo¿esz wybraæ
dowoln± wersjê kiedykolwiek opublikowan± przez Fundacjê.

  10. Je¶li chcesz w³±czyæ czê¶ci Programu do innych
wolnych programów, których warunki rozpowszechniania s±
inne, zwróæ siê pisemnie do autora z pro¶b± o pozwolenie.
W przypadku oprogramowania objêtego przez Fundacjê prawem
autorskim, napisz do Fundacji; czasami czynimy od tego
odstêpstwa. W naszej decyzji kierujemy siê dwoma celami:
utrzymania wolnego statusu wszystkich pochodnych naszego
wolnego oprogramowania oraz - generalnie - promowania
wspó³udzia³u i wielokrotnego stosowania oprogramowania.

  Jak stosowaæ niniejsze Warunki do Twoich nowych
programów

  Je¶li opracowujesz nowy program i chcia³by¶, aby sta³
siê on przydatny dla szerokiego ogó³u, najlepsz± drog± do
osi±gniêcia tego bêdzie nadanie twemu programowi
charakteru wolnego oprogramowania, które ka¿dy mo¿e
