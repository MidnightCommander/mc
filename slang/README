This is the S-Lang library, version 1.4.9.  It has been radically
stripped down to remove functions that are either unused by the Midnight
Commander or already provided by the glib library.  The complete
distribution can be downloaded from:

http://www.s-lang.org/

The sources in this directory are only used if you don't have the S-Lang
library installed on your system or if you request to use these sources
by specifying the option `--with-screen=mcslang' to the `configure'
script.
