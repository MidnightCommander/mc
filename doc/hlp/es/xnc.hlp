                 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

    Everyone is  permitted  to copy  and  distribute  verbatim copies of this  license  document,  but  changing  it  is  not allowed.

                         Preamble

    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom  to  share  and  change the works. By contrast, the  GNU  General  Public  License  is intended to guarantee your freedom to  share  and  change  all versions of a program to make sure it  remains  free  software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,  use  the GNU General Public  License  for  most  of  our  software;  it applies also to any  other  work  released  this  way  by  its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring  to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses  are  designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them  if  you  wish),  that  you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free  programs, and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these  rights  or  asking  you  to  surrender  the rights. Therefore, you have certain  responsibilities  if  you distribute copies of  the  software,  or  if  you  modify  it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source  code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you  this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuseoccurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
---------------

    “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

    “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

    To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

    A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

    To “propagate” a work means to do anything with  it  that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

    To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

    An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.


1. Source Code.
---------------

    The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

    A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

    The  “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

    The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is
that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
---------------------

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
--------------------------------------------------------------

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-----------------------------

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
--------------------------------------

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modificationsto produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to applyto the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
------------------------------

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
  c) Convey individual copies of the  object code  with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

    A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

    “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
--------------------

    “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
  c) Prohibiting  misrepresentation of the origin of that  material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
---------------

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your  rights  under  this  License  (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
---------------------------------------------

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-------------------------------------------------

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets  of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's  predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
------------

    A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

    A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to  copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

    A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
------------------------------------

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
---------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
-------------------------------------

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public  License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

[Warranty]
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
---------------------------

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
----------------------------

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-----------------------------------------

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.


    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Licencia Pública GNU

Esta es la conocida como GNU General Public License (GPL), versión 3 (de junio de 2007), que cubre la mayor parte del software de la Free Software Foundation, y muchos más programas.

    IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License into spanish. It was not published by the Free Software Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for software that uses the GNU GPL —only the original English text of the GNU GPL does that. However, we hope that this translation will help spanish speakers understand the GNU GPL better.

    NOTA IMPORTANTE:

    LICENCIA PÚBLICA GENERAL GNU

    Versión 3, 29 de junio de 2007

    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Se permite la copia y distribución de copias literales de esta licencia, pero no está permitido modificarla.

    Preámbulo

La Licencia Pública General GNU (GNU GPL) es una licencia libre, sin derechos para software y otro tipo de trabajos.

Las licencias para la mayoría del software y otros trabajos prácticos están destinadas a suprimir la libertad de compartir y modificar esos trabajos. Por el contrario, la Licencia Pública General GNU persigue garantizar su libertad para compartir y modificar todas las versiones de un programa--y asegurar que permanecerá como software libre para todos sus usuarios. Nosotros, La Fundación de Software Libre, usamos la Licencia Pública General GNU para la mayoría de nuestro software; y también se aplica a cualquier trabajo realizado de la misma forma por sus autores. Usted también puede aplicarla a sus programas.

Cuando hablamos de software libre, nos referimos a libertad, no a precio. Nuestras Licencias Públicas Generales están destinadas a garantizar la libertad de distribuir copias de software libre (y cobrar por ello si quiere), a recibir el código fuente o poder conseguirlo si así lo desea, a modificar el software o usar parte del mismo en nuevos programas libres, y a saber que puede hacer estas cosas.

Para proteger sus derechos, necesitamos evitar que otros le nieguen esos derechos o le pidan renunciar a ellos. Por lo tanto, usted tiene ciertas responsabilidades cuando distribuye copias del software, o si lo modifica: responsabilidades que persiguen respetar la libertad de otros.

Por ejemplo, si distribuye copias de tales programas, gratuitamente o no, debe transmitir a los destinatarios los mismos derechos que usted recibió. Debe asegurarse que ellos también reciban o puedan conseguir el código fuente. Y debe mostrarles estos términos y condiciones para que conozcan sus derechos.

Los desarrolladores que usen la GPL GNU protegen sus derechos de dos formas: (1) imponen derechos al software, y (2) le ofrecen esta Licencia para que legalmente lo copie, distribuya y/o modifique.

Para proteger a desarrolladores y autores, la GPL expone claramente que no existe garantía alguna para este software libre. Para beneficio de ambos, usuarios y autores, la GPL establece que las versiones modificadas deberán estar identificadas como tales, para que cualquier problema no sea atribuido por error a los autores de versiones anteriores.

Algunos dispositivos están diseñados para negar al usuario la instalación o la ejecución de versiones modificadas del software que usan internamente, aunque el fabricante sí pueda hacerlo. Esto es completamente incompatible con el objetivo de proteger la libertad de los usuarios para modificar el software. Este tipo de abuso sistemático ocurre con productos de uso personal, que es precisamente donde es menos aceptable. Por tanto, hemos diseñado esta versión de la GPL para prohibir estas prácticas en esos productos. Si apareciesen problemas similares en otros ámbitos, estaremos preparados para extender estas prestaciones a las próximas versiones de la GPL, tanto como sea necesario para proteger la libertad de los usuarios.

Por último, todo programa está constantemente amenazado por las patentes de software. Los estados no deberían permitir que las patentes restrinjan el desarrollo y el uso de software en ordenadores de uso general; pero en aquellos que lo hagan, esperamos evitar el especial peligro que suponen las patentes, que aplicadas a un programa libre puedan hacerlo propietario en la práctica. Para prevenir eso, la GPL establece que las patentes no pueden usarse para convertir un programa en no-libre.

A continuación se exponen los términos y condiciones para la copia, distribución y modificación.

    TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES

    0. Definiciones.

En adelante "Esta Licencia" se refiere a la versión 3 de la Licencia Pública General GNU.

"Copyright" también significa "leyes similares al copyright" que son aplicables a otro tipo de trabajos, tales como las máscaras de semiconductores.

"El Programa" se refiere a cualquier trabajo con copyright al que se haya aplicado esta Licencia. Cada beneficiario es asimilable a "usted". "Beneficiarios" y "destinatarios" pueden ser personas físicas u organizaciones.

"Modificar" un trabajo significa copiar o adaptar todo o parte de un trabajo, exceptuando la copia exacta, de manera que se requiera permiso de copyright. El trabajo resultante se denomina "versión modificada" de un trabajo anterior o trabajo "basado en" el trabajo anterior.

Un "trabajo amparado" puede ser tanto el Programa no modificado como un trabajo basado en el Programa.

"Difundir" un trabajo significa hacer cualquier cosa con él, sin permiso, que le haga directa o indirectamente responsable de infringir leyes cubiertas por copyright, excepto la ejecución en un ordenador o la modificación de una copia privada. La difusión incluye la copia, distribución (con o sin modificaciones), distribución pública, y en algunos países también otras actividades.

"Distribuir" un trabajo implica cualquier tipo de difusión que permite a la otra parte hacer o recibir copias. La mera interacción con un usuario mediante una red de ordenadores, sin transferir copia alguna, no se considera "distribución".

Una interfaz de usuario interactiva muestra "Avisos Legales Apropiados" siempre y cuando incluya características visuales apropiadas y destacadas que (1) muestren un aviso de copyright apropiado, y (2) indiquen al usuario que no existe garantía alguna para el trabajo (exceptuando las garantías que se hayan podido establecer), que los beneficiarios deben distribuir el trabajo según se establece en la presente Licencia, y cómo se puede ver una copia de esta Licencia. Si la interfaz muestra una lista de opciones o comandos, tales como menús, un elemento destacado en dicha lista cumple estos criterios.

    1. Código Fuente.

El "código fuente" de un trabajo es el formato preferido para realizar modificaciones sobre él. "Código objeto" se refiere a cualquier formato del trabajo que no sea código fuente.

Una "Interfaz Estándar" se refiere a una interfaz que sea o bien un estándar oficial definido por una institución de estándares reconocida, o bien, en el caso de interfaces específicos para una determinado lenguaje de programación, una cuyo uso esté generalizada entre los desarrolladores que trabajan con ese lenguaje.

Las "Bibliotecas de Sistema" de un trabajo ejecutable incluyen a cualquier elemento, que no sea el trabajo completo, que (a) esté incluida/o de la misma forma que un componente principal, pero que no forme parte de ese componente principal, y (b) sólo sirva para habilitar la utilización del trabajo a través de ese componente principal, o para implementar un Interfaz Estándar para el cual está disponible una implementación pública en código fuente. Un "Componente Principal", en este contexto, se refiere a un componente principal y esencial (núcleo, sistema de ventanas y similares) del sistema operativo particular (en su caso) sobre el cual funcione el ejecutable, o un compilador utilizado para generar el trabajo, o un intérprete del código objeto utilizado para ejecutarlo.

La "Fuente Correspondiente" de un trabajo en código objeto se refiere a todo código fuente necesario para generar, instalar, y (en el caso de trabajos ejecutables) ejecutar el código objeto y modificar el trabajo, incluyendo guiones que controlen esas actividades. Sin embargo, no se incluyen las Bibliotecas de Sistema del trabajo, o herramientas de propósito general o programas gratuitos habitualmente disponibles y usados sin ninguna modificación para realizar estas actividades pero que no forman parte del trabajo. Por ejemplo, la Fuente Correspondiente incluye los archivos de definición de interfaz asociados con archivos fuente del trabajo, y el código fuente de las bibliotecas compartidas o subprogramas enlazados dinámicamente que el programa requiere por diseño, como la comunicación de datos intrínseca o el control de flujo entre esos subprogramas y otras partes del trabajo.

La Fuente Correspondiente no incluye necesariamente aquello que los usuarios pueden regenerar automáticamente a partir de otras partes de la Fuente Correspondiente.

La Fuente Correspondiente de un trabajo en código fuente es ese mismo trabajo.

    2. Permisos Básicos.

Todos los derechos garantizados por esta Licencia se otorgan como copyright del Programa, y se proporcionan de manera irrevocable siempre y cuando se cumplan las condiciones establecidas. Esta Licencia afirma explícitamente su permiso ilimitado para ejecutar el Programa sin modificaciones. El resultado de la ejecución de un programa amparado está cubierto por esta Licencia sólo en el caso de que la salida, por su contenido, constituya un trabajo amparado. Esta Licencia reconoce sus derechos de uso razonable u otro equivalente, tal y como determina la ley de copyright.

Usted podrá realizar, ejecutar y difundir trabajos amparados que no distribuya, sin condición alguna, siempre y cuando no tenga otra licencia más restrictiva. Podrá distribuir trabajos amparados a terceros con el mero objetivo de que ellos hagan modificaciones exclusivamente para usted, o para que le proporcionen ayuda para ejecutar esos trabajos, siempre que cumpla los términos de esta Licencia distribuyendo todo el material de cuyo copyright no posee el control. Aquellos que realicen o ejecuten los trabajos amparados para usted deben hacerlo exclusivamente en su nombre, bajo su dirección y control, con términos que les prohíban realizar copias de su material con copyright al margen de la relación con usted.

La distribución bajo otras circunstancias se permite únicamente bajo las condiciones establecidas más abajo. No está permitido sublicenciar; la claúsula 10 lo hace innecesario.

    3. Protección de Derechos Legales de los Usuarios frente a Leyes Anti-Burla.

Ningún trabajo amparado debe considerarse parte de una medida tecnológica efectiva, a tenor de lo establecido en cualquier ley aplicable que cumpla las obligaciones expresas en el artículo 11 del tratado de copyright WIPO adoptado el 20 de diciembre de 1996, o leyes similares que prohíben o restringen la burla de tales medidas.

Cuando distribuya un trabajo amparado, renuncia a cualquier poder legal para prohibir la burla de medidas tecnológicas mientras tales burlas se realicen en ejercicio de derechos amparados por esta Licencia respecto al trabajo amparado; además, usted negará cualquier intención de limitar el uso o modificación del trabajo con el objetivo de imponer, al trabajo de los usuarios, sus derechos legales o de terceros para prohibir la burla de medidas tecnológicas.

    4. Distribución de copias literales.

Usted podrá distribuir copias literales del código fuente del Programa tal y como lo ha recibido , por cualquier medio, siempre que publique de forma clara y llamativa en cada copia el correspondiente aviso de copyright ; mantenga intactos todos los avisos que establezcan que esta Licencia y cualquier término no-permisivo añadido y acorde con la cláusula 7 son aplicables al código; mantenga intactos todos los avisos de ausencia de garantía; y proporcione a todos los destinatarios una copia de esta Licencia junto con el Programa.

Usted podrá cobrar cualquier importe o no cobrar nada por cada copia que distribuya, y podrá ofrecer soporte o protección de garantía mediante un pago.

    5. Distribución de Versiones Modificadas de Código.

Usted podrá distribuir un trabajo basado en el Programa, o las modificaciones que lo producen a partir del Programa, como código fuente en virtud de los términos establecidos en la cláusula 4, siempre que cumpla todas las condiciones siguientes:

    a) El trabajo debe incluir avisos destacados indicando que usted lo ha modificado y dando una fecha pertinente.
    b) El trabajo debe incluir avisos destacados indicando que está realizado a tenor de lo dispuesto en la presente Licencia y en cualquier otra condición añadida en virtud de la cláusula 7. Este requisito modifica el requisito de "mantener intactos todos los avisos" expuesto en la claúsula 4.
    c) En virtud del presente documento, usted deberá aplicar la licencia al trabajo completo, como un todo, a cualquier persona que esté en posesión de una copia. Por lo tanto, esta Licencia se aplicará junto con cualquier otra condición adicional aplicable de la cláusula 7, al conjunto completo del trabajo y todas y cada una de sus partes, independientemente de como sean agrupadas o empaquetadas. Esta Licencia no permite ser aplicada al trabajo de ninguna otra forma, pero no se anula dicho permiso si usted lo ha recibido por separado.
    d) Si el trabajo tiene interfaces de usuario interactivos, cada uno debe mostrar Avisos Legales Apropiados; sin embargo, si el Programa tiene interfaces interactivos que no muestran Avisos Legales Apropiados, su trabajo no tiene porqué modificarlos para que lo hagan.

Un conjunto o recopilación formado por un trabajo amparado y otros trabajos distintos e independientes, que por su naturaleza no sean ampliaciones del trabajo amparado, que no se combinen con él de alguna forma para dar lugar a un programa mayor, y que estén ubicados en un medio de distribución o almacenamiento, se denomina "paquete" si la recopilación y su copyright al completo no son usados para limitar el acceso o los derechos legales de los usuarios de la recopilación, más allá de lo que permita el trabajo individual. La inclusión de un trabajo amparado en un paquete no hace aplicable esta Licencia al resto de elementos del paquete.

    6. Distribución de código No-fuente.

Usted podrá distribuir el código objeto de un trabajo amparado en virtud de los términos de las cláusulas 4 y 5, siempre que también distribuya las Fuentes Correspondientes en código máquina, de acuerdo con los términos establecidos en esta Licencia, de alguna de las siguientes maneras:

    a) Distribuir el código objeto en, o embebido en, un producto físico (incluyendo medios de distribución físicos), acompañado de las Fuentes Correspondientes en un medio físico duradero y que sea utilizado habitualmente para el intercambio de software.
    b) Distribuir el código objeto en, o embebido en, un producto físico (incluyendo medios de distribución físicos), acompañado de una oferta por escrito, válida al menos durante tres años y válida durante el tiempo en el que usted ofrezca recambios o soporte para ese modelo de producto, con el fin de ofrecer al poseedor del código objeto (1) una copia de las Fuentes Correspondientes a todo el software del producto que esté cubierto por esta Licencia, en un medio físico duradero habitual para el intercambio de software, a un precio no mayor que su coste razonable por distribuir físicamente las fuentes, o (2) acceso para copiar las fuentes correspondientes desde un servidor de red sin coste alguno.
    c) Distribuir copias individuales del código objeto junto con una copia de la oferta por escrito para/con el fin de proporcionar las Fuentes Correspondientes. Esta alternativa sólo está permitida ocasionalmente, pero no de forma comercial, y solamente si usted recibió el código objeto junto con una oferta parecida, de acuerdo con la subcláusula 6b.
    d) Distribuir el código objeto ofreciendo acceso desde un lugar determinado (gratuitamente o mediante pago), y ofrecer acceso equivalente a las Fuentes Correspondientes de la misma forma y en el mismo lugar sin cargo añadido. No es necesario exigir a los destinatarios que copien las Fuentes Correspondientes junto con el código objeto. Si el lugar para copiar el código objeto es un servidor de red, las Fuentes Correspondientes pueden estar en un servidor diferente (gestionado por usted o terceros) que ofrezca facilidades de copia equivalentes, siempre que mantenga instrucciones claras junto al código objeto especificando dónde encontrar las Fuentes Correspondientes. Independientemente de qué servidores alberguen las Fuentes Correspondientes, usted seguirá obligado a asegurar que estarán disponibles durante el tiempo necesario para cumplir estos requisitos.
    e) Distribuir el código mediante transferencias entre usuarios, siempre que informe a otros usuarios dónde se ofrecen el código objeto y las Fuentes Correspondientes de forma pública sin cargo alguno, tal y como se establece en la subcláusula 6d.

Una parte separable del código objeto, cuyo código fuente esté excluido de las Fuentes Correspondientes como Biblioteca de Sistema, no necesita ser incluida en la distribución del código objeto del trabajo.

Un "Producto de Usuario" es tanto (1) un "producto de consumo", que se refiere a cualquier propiedad personal tangible habitualmente utilizada para fines personales, familiares o domésticos, o (2) cualquier cosa diseñada o vendida para ser incorporada como extensión/expansión para otro producto. Para determinar si un producto es un producto de consumo, los casos dudosos se resolverán favoreciendo el amparo. En el caso de un producto concreto recibido por un usuario particular, "de uso habitual" se refiere al uso típico o corriente de ese tipo de producto, independientemente de la situación del usuario particular o de la forma en que el usuario concreto utilice, o pretenda o se espere que pretenda utilizar, el producto. Un producto es un producto de consumo independientemente de si el producto tiene usos sustancialmente comerciales, industriales o distintos del consumo, a menos que tales usos representen la única forma posible de utilizar el producto.

Las "Instrucciones de Instalación" para un Producto de Usuario se refieren a cualquier método, procedimiento, clave de autorización, u otro tipo de información necesaria para instalar y ejecutar una versión modificada de un trabajo amparado en ese Producto de Usuario a partir de una versión modificada de las Fuentes Correspondientes. Las instrucciones deben ser suficientes para asegurar el funcionamiento continuo del código objeto modificado sin ningún tipo de condicionamiento o intromisión por el simple hecho de haber sido modificado.

Si, bajo las premisas de esta cláusula, usted distribuye el código objeto de un trabajo en, o con un Producto de Usuario o específicamente para ser usado en el mismo, y la distribución forma parte de una transacción donde los derechos de posesión y uso del Producto de Usuario se transfieren al destinatario a perpetuidad o durante un plazo fijo de tiempo (independientemente de las características de la transacción), las Fuentes Correspondientes distribuidas bajo estos supuestos deben acompañarse de las Instrucciones de Instalación. Sin embargo, estos requerimientos no se aplican si ni usted ni terceros tienen posibilidad de instalar el código objeto modificado en el Producto de Usuario (por ejemplo, el trabajo ha sido instalado en memoria de sólo lectura, ROM):

El requerimiento de proporcionar Información de Instalación no incluye el hecho de continuar proporcionando servicio de soporte, garantía, o actualizaciones para un trabajo que haya sido modificado o instalado por el destinatario, o para el Producto de Usuario en el que se haya modificado o instalado. El acceso a la red puede ser denegado cuando la propia modificación afecte materialmente y de forma adversa a la operación de la red o viole las reglas y protocolos de comunicación en la red.

Las Fuentes Correspondientes distribuidas, y las Instrucciones de Instalación proporcionadas de acuerdo con esta cláusula, deben figurar en un formato documentado públicamente (y con una implementación disponible para el público en código fuente), y no deben necesitar claves de acceso especiales para la descompresión, lectura o copia.

    7. Condiciones adicionales.

Los "Permisos Adicionales" son condicionantes que amplían los términos de esta Licencia permitiendo excepciones a una o más de sus condiciones. Los Permisos Adicionales que son aplicables al Programa completo deberán ser tratados como si estuviesen incluidos en esta Licencia, hasta los límites de validez impuestos por las leyes aplicables. Si los permisos adicionales se aplicasen sólo a una parte del Programa, esa parte podría ser usada de forma independiente en virtud de dichos permisos, pero el Programa completo seguiría estando afectado por esta Licencia con independencia de los permisos adicionales.

Cuando distribuya una copia de un trabajo amparado, usted podrá opcionalmente eliminar cualquier permiso adicional de esa copia, o de alguna parte del mismo. (Los permisos adicionales pueden haber establecido que sea requerida su eliminación en ciertos supuestos si usted modifica el trabajo.) Usted puede establecer permisos adicionales en material añadido por usted a un trabajo amparado, sobre el cual tiene o podrá aportar sus permisos de copyright correspondientes.

Sin contravenir cualquier otra estipulación en esta Licencia, usted podrá, para el material que añada a un trabajo amparado, (si está autorizado por los poseedores de copyright de ese material) añadir condiciones a esta Licencia con los siguientes términos:

    a) Ausencia de garantía o limitación de responsabilidad diferente de los términos establecidos en las cláusulas 15 y 16 de esta Licencia; u
    b) Obligación de mantener determinados avisos legales razonables o atribuciones de autoría en el material o en los Avisos Legales Correspondientes mostrados por los trabajos que lo contengan; o
    c) Prohibir la tergiversación del origen del material, o solicitar que las diferencias respecto a la versión original sean señaladas de forma apropiada en las versiones modificadas del material; o
    d) Limitar la utilización de los nombres de los autores o beneficiarios del material con fines divulgativos; o
    e) Negarse a ofrecer derechos afectados por leyes de registro para el uso de marcas empresariales, registradas o de servicio; o
    f) Exigir indemnización a los autores y poseedores de la licencia de ese material, por parte de cualquier persona que distribuya el material (o versiones modificadas del mismo), estableciendo obligaciones contractuales de responsabilidad sobre el destinatario, para cualquier responsabilidad que estas obligaciones contractuales impongan directamente sobre los autores y poseedores de licencia.

Cualesquiera otras condiciones adicionales no-permisivas son consideradas "otras restricciones" en el contexto de la cláusula 10. Si el Programa, tal cual lo recibió, o cualquier parte del mismo, contiene un aviso indicando que está amparado por esta Licencia junto a una cláusula de restricción posterior específica, usted podrá suprimir esa cláusula. Si un documento de licencia contiene una restricción de este tipo pero permite modificar la licencia o la distribución en virtud de la presente Licencia, usted podrá añadirla al material de un trabajo amparado por los términos de ese documento de licencia, siempre que dicha restricción no se mantenga tras la modificación de la licencia o la distribución.

Si añade condiciones para un trabajo amparado, a tenor de lo establecido en la presente cláusula, usted deberá ubicar, en los archivos fuente involucrados, una declaración de los términos adicionales aplicables a esos archivos, o un aviso indicando dónde localizar los términos aplicables.

Las condiciones adicionales, permisivas o no, deben aparecer por escrito como licencias separadas, o figurar como excepciones; de todas formas, los requisitos anteriores siempre son aplicables.

    8. Cancelación.

Usted no podrá distribuir o modificar un trabajo amparado salvo de la forma en la que se ha previsto expresamente en esta Licencia. Cualquier intento diferente de distribución o modificación será considerado nulo, y automáticamente cancelará sus derechos respecto a esta Licencia (incluyendo cualquier patente conseguida según el párrafo tercero de la cláusula 11).

Sin embargo, si deja de violar esta Licencia, entonces su licencia desde el poseedor del copyright correspondiente será restituida (a) provisionalmente, a menos que y hasta que el poseedor del copyright dé por terminada explícita y permanentemente su licencia, y (b) permanentemente, si el poseedor del copyright no le ha notificado por algún cauce de la violación no después de los 60 días posteriores al cese.

Además, su licencia desde el poseedor del copyright correspondiente será restituida permanentemente si el poseedor del copyright le notifica de la violación por algún cauce, es la primera vez que recibe la notificación de violación de esta Licencia (para cualquier trabajo) de ese poseedor de copyright, y usted subsana la violación antes de 30 días desde la recepción del aviso.

La cancelación de sus derechos según esta cláusula no da por canceladas las licencias de terceros que hayan recibido copias o derechos a través de usted con esta Licencia. Si sus derechos han finalizado y no han sido restituidos de forma permanente, usted no está capacitado para recibir nuevas licencias para el mismo material en virtud de la cláusula 10.

    9. Aceptación no obligatoria por tenencia de copias.

No está obligado a aceptar esta Licencia por recibir o ejecutar una copia del Programa. La distribución de un trabajo amparado surgida simplemente como consecuencia de la transmisión entre usuarios para obtener una copia tampoco requiere aceptación. Sin embargo, únicamente esta Licencia le otorga permiso para distribuir o modificar cualquier trabajo amparado. Estas acciones infringen el copyright si usted no acepta las los términos y condiciones de esta Licencia. Por lo tanto, al modificar o distribuir un trabajo amparado, usted indica que acepta la Licencia.

    10. Herencia automática de licencia para destinatarios.

Cada vez que distribuya un trabajo amparado, el destinatario recibirá automáticamente una licencia desde los poseedores originales, para ejecutar, modificar y distribuir ese trabajo, al amparo de los términos de esta Licencia. Usted no será responsable de asegurar el cumplimiento por terceros de esta Licencia.

Una "transacción de entidad" es una transacción que transfiere el control de una organización, o todos los bienes sustanciales de una, o subdivide una organización, o fusiona organizaciones. Si la distribución de un trabajo amparado surge de una transacción de entidad, cada parte involucrada en esa transacción que reciba una copia del trabajo, también recibe todas y cada una de las licencias existentes del trabajo que la parte interesada tuviese o pudiese ofrecer según el párrafo anterior, además del derecho a tomar posesión de las Fuentes Correspondientes del trabajo a través de la parte interesada, si está en poder de dicha parte o se puede conseguir con un esfuerzo razonable.

Usted no podrá imponer restricciones posteriores en el ejercicio de los derechos otorgados o concedidos en virtud de la presente Licencia. Por ejemplo, usted no puede imponer a la licencia pagos, derechos u otros cargos por el ejercicio de los derechos otorgados según esta Licencia; además no podrá iniciar litigios (incluyendo demandas o contrademandas en pleitos) alegando que se infringen patentes por cambiar, usar, vender, ofrecer en venta o importar el Programa, o cualquier parte del mismo.

    11. Patentes.

Un "colaborador" es un poseedor de copyright que autoriza el uso del Programa o un trabajo en el que se base el Programa bajo los términos y condiciones establecidos en la presente Licencia. El trabajo con esta licencia se denomina "versión en colaboración" con el colaborador.

Todas las reivindicaciones de patentes en posesión o controladas por el colaborador se denominan "demandas de patente original", ya sean existentes o adquiridas con posterioridad, que hayan sido infringidas de alguna forma permitida por esta Licencia, al hacer, usar o vender la versión en colaboración, pero sin incluir demandas que sólo sean infracciones como consecuencia de modificaciones posteriores de la versión en colaboración. Para aclarar esta definición, "control" incluye el derecho de conceder sublicencias de patente de forma que no contravenga los requisitos establecidos en la presente Licencia.

Cada colaborador le concede a usted una licencia de la patente no-exclusiva, global y libre de derechos bajo las reivindicaciones de patente de origen del colaborador, para el uso, modificación, venta, ofertas de venta, importación y otras formas de ejecución, modificación y redistribución del contenido de la versión en colaboración.

En los siguientes tres párrafos, una "licencia de patente" se refiere a cualquier acuerdo o compromiso expreso y manifiesto, cualquiera que sea su denominación, que no imponga una patente (como puede ser el permiso expreso para ejecutar una patente o acuerdos para no imponer demandas por infracción de patente). "Conceder" estas licencias de patente a un tercero significa llegar a tal tipo de acuerdo o compromiso que no imponga una patente al tercero.

Si usted distribuye un trabajo amparado, conociendo que está afectado por una licencia de patente, y no están disponibles de forma pública para su copia las Fuentes Correspondientes, sin cargo alguno y bajo los términos de esta Licencia, ya sea a través de un servidor de red público o mediante cualquier otro medio, entonces usted deberá o bien (1) permitir que sean públicas las Fuentes Correspondientes, o (2) tratar de eliminar los beneficios de la licencia de patente para este trabajo en particular, o (3) tratar de extender, de una forma que no contravenga los requisitos de esta Licencia, la licencia de patente a terceros. "Conocer que está afectado" significa que usted tiene conocimiento real de que, para la licencia de patente, la distribución del trabajo amparado en un determinado país, o el uso del trabajo amparado por sus destinatarios en un determinado país, infringiría una o más patentes existentes en ese país que usted considera aplicables por algún motivo.

Si, de conformidad con alguna transacción o acuerdo(o en un proceso relacionado con ellos), usted distribuye o distribuye con fines de distribución , un trabajo amparado, concediendo una licencia de patente para algún tercero que reciba el trabajo amparado, y autorizándole a usar, distribuir, modificar o distribuir una copia específica del trabajo amparado, entonces la licencia de patente que usted otorgue se extiende automáticamente a todos los receptores del trabajo amparado y cualquier trabajo basado en el mismo.

Una licencia de patente es "discriminatoria" si no incluye dentro de su ámbito de cobertura, prohíbe el ejercicio, o está condicionada a no ejercitar uno o más de los derechos que están específicamente otorgados por esta Licencia. Usted no debe distribuir un trabajo amparado si está implicado en un acuerdo con terceros que estén relacionados con el negocio de la distribución de software, en el que usted haga pagos relacionados con su actividad de distribución del trabajo, y donde se otorgue, a cualquier receptor del trabajo amparado, una licencia de patente discriminatoria (a) en relación con las copias del trabajo amparado distribuido por usted (o copias hechas a partir de éstas), o (b) directa o indirectamente relacionadas con productos específicos o paquetes que contengan el trabajo amparado, a menos que usted forme parte del acuerdo, o que esa licencia de patente fuese otorgada antes del 28 de marzo de 2007.

Ninguna disposición de esta Licencia se considerará como excluyente o limitante de la aplicación de cualquier otra licencia o defensas legales contra la violación de las leyes de propiedad intelectual a que pudiera tener derecho bajo la ley de propiedad intelectual vigente.

    12. No condicionamiento de la libertad de terceros.

Si a usted le son impuestas condiciones que contravienen las estipuladas en la presente Licencia (ya sea por orden judicial, acuerdo u otros), no quedará eximido de cumplir las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si usted no puede distribuir un trabajo amparado cumpliendo simultáneamente sus obligaciones con esta Licencia y con cualquier otra pertinente, entonces no podrá distribuirlo de ninguna forma. Por ejemplo, si usted se compromete con términos que le obligan a obtener derechos por la distribución a terceros, la única forma de satisfacer ambos condicionantes y esta Licencia es abstenerse completamente de distribuir el Programa.

    13. Uso conjunto con la Licencia Pública General Affero GNU.

Sin contravenir las disposiciones de la presente Licencia, usted tendrá permiso para enlazar o combinar cualquier trabajo amparado con otro trabajo amparado por la versión 3 de la Licencia Pública General Affero GNU y formar un solo trabajo combinado, y distribuir el trabajo resultante. Los términos de esta Licencia seguirán siendo aplicables a la parte formada por el trabajo amparado, pero los condicionantes especiales de la Licencia Pública General Affero GNU, en su cláusula 13, relativos a la interacción mediante redes, serán aplicables a la combinación de ambas partes.

    14. Versiones Revisadas de esta Licencia.

La Fundación para el Software Libre podrá publicar revisiones y/o nuevas versiones de la Licencia Pública General GNU de vez en cuando. Esas versiones serán similares en espíritu a la versión actual, pero podrán diferir en algunos detalles para afrontar nuevos problemas o situaciones.

A cada versión se le da un número distintivo. Si el Programa especifica que le es aplicable cierto número de versión de la Licencia Pública General o "cualquier versión posterior", usted tendrá la posibilidad de adoptar los términos y condiciones de la versión indicada o de cualquier otra versión posterior publicada por la Fundación para el Software Libre. Si el Programa no especifica un número de versión de la Licencia Pública General, usted podrá elegir cualquier versión que haya sido publicada por la Fundación para el Software Libre.

Si el Programa especifica que un apoderado/representante puede decidir qué versiones de la Licencia Pública General pueden aplicarse en el futuro, la declaración pública de aceptación que el apoderado/representante haga de una versión le autoriza a usted con carácter permanente a elegir esa versión para el Programa.

Versiones posteriores de la licencia podrán otorgarle permisos adicionales o diferentes. Sin embargo, no podrán imponerse obligaciones adicionales a cualquier autor o poseedor de copyright como consecuencia de que usted adopte una versión posterior.

    15. Ausencia de Garantía.

EL PROGRAMA NO TIENE GARANTÍA ALGUNA, HASTA LOS LÍMITES PERMITIDOS POR LAS LEYES APLICABLES. SALVO CUANDO SE ESTABLEZCA LO CONTRARIO POR ESCRITO, EL POSEEDOR DEL COPYRIGHT Y/O TERCEROS PROPORCIONARÁN EL PROGRAMA "TAL CUAL" SIN GARANTÍA DE NINGÚN TIPO, YA SEA EXPLÍCITA O IMPLÍCITA, INCLUYENDO, PERO SIN LIMITARSE A, LAS GARANTÍAS IMPLÍCITAS MERCANTILES Y DE APTITUD PARA UN PROPÓSITO DETERMINADO. USTED ASUMIRÁ CUALQUIER RIESGO RELATIVO A LA CALIDAD Y RENDIMIENTO DEL PROGRAMA. SI EL PROGRAMA FUESE DEFECTUOSO, USTED ASUMIRÁ CUALQUIER COSTE DE SERVICIO, REPARACIÓN O CORRECCIÓN.

    16. Limitación de Responsabilidad.

EN NINGÚN CASO, SALVO REQUERIMIENTO POR LEYES APLICABLES O MEDIANTE ACUERDO POR ESCRITO, PODRÁ UN POSEEDOR DE COPYRIGHT, O UN TERCERO QUE MODIFIQUE O DISTRIBUYA EL PROGRAMA SEGÚN LO INDICADO ANTERIORMENTE, HACERLE A USTED RESPONSABLE DE DAÑO ALGUNO, INCLUYENDO CUALQUIER DAÑO GENERAL, ESPECIAL, OCASIONAL O DERIVADO QUE SURJA DEL USO O LA INCAPACIDAD DE USO DEL PROGRAMA (INCLUYENDO PERO SIN LIMITARSE A LA PÉRDIDA DE DATOS O LA PRESENTACIÓN NO PRECISA DE LOS MISMOS O A PÉRDIDAS SUFRIDAS POR USTED O TERCEROS O AL FALLO DEL PROGRAMA AL INTERACTUAR CON OTROS PROGRAMAS), INCLUSO EN EL CASO DE QUE EL POSEEDOR O UN TERCERO HAYA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS.

    17. Interpretación de las cláusulas 15 y 16.

Si la ausencia de garantía y la limitación de responsabilidad descrita anteriormente no tuviesen efecto legal a nivel local en todos sus términos, los juzgados aplicarán las leyes locales que más se aproximen a la exención de responsabilidad civil en lo relativo al Programa, a menos que la copia del Programa esté acompañada mediante pago de una garantía o compromiso de responsabilidad.

FIN DE TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES

    Cómo aplicar estas condiciones a sus nuevos programas

Si usted desarrolla un nuevo programa, y quiere darle al público el mayor uso posible del mismo, la mejor forma de conseguirlo es hacerlo software libre para que cualquiera pueda redistribuirlo y modificarlo bajo estas condiciones.

Para ello, adjunte los siguientes avisos al programa. Es más seguro adjuntarlos al inicio de cada archivo fuente para hacer más explícita la ausencia de garantía; y cada archivo debería tener al menos la línea de "copyright" y un enlace a la versión completa del aviso.

    <una línea con el nombre del programa y una breve idea de su objetivo.>
    Copyright (C) <año>  <nombre del autor>

    Este programa es software libre: usted puede redistribuirlo y/o modificarlo
    bajo los términos de la Licencia Pública General GNU publicada

    Este programa se distribuye con la esperanza de que sea útil, pero
    SIN GARANTÍA ALGUNA; ni siquiera la garantía implícita
    MERCANTIL o de APTITUD PARA UN PROPÓSITO DETERMINADO.
    Consulte los detalles de la Licencia Pública General GNU para obtener

    Debería haber recibido una copia de la Licencia Pública General GNU
    junto a este programa.
    En caso contrario, consulte <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Incluya además información de cómo contactar con usted por correo electrónico y ordinario.

Si el programa es interactivo, haga que muestre un breve aviso como el siguiente cuando se inicie en modo interactivo:

    <programa>  Copyright (C) <año>  <nombre del autor>
    Este programa se ofrece SIN GARANTÍA ALGUNA;
    escriba 'show w' para consultar los detalles.
    Es software libre, y usted puede redistribuirlo bajo ciertas condiciones;
    escriba 'show c' para más información.

Los hipotéticos comandos 'show w' y 'show c' deberían mostrar las partes correspondientes de la Licencia Pública General. Por supuesto, los comandos en su programa podrían ser diferentes; en un interfaz gráfico de usuario, podría usar un mensaje del tipo "Acerca de".

También debería conseguir que su empresa (si trabaja como programador) o escuela, en su caso, firme una "renuncia de copyright" sobre el programa, si fuese necesario. Para más información a este respecto, y saber cómo aplicar y cumplir la licencia GNU GPL, consulte <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

La Licencia Pública General GNU no permite incorporar sus programas como parte de programas propietarios. Si su programa es una subrutina en una biblioteca, resultaría mucho más útil habilitar el enlace de aplicaciones propietarias a la biblioteca. Si es esto lo que quiere hacer, utilice la Licencia Pública General Reducida GNU en vez de esta Licencia. Pero por favor, consulte primero <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
