The input file was created by doing "arc v test.arc" on archive created
with "arc a test.arc ...". We then made sure to have:

- One date prior to year 2000 (to test the 1900/2000 boundary).
- Both AM and PM times.

Our 'uarc' doesn't support spaces in filenames but that's no biggie:

    Man page: "Full compatibility with PC ARC files is maintained, the
    price for which is that arc doesn't like long filenames, and can only
    archive files with names of up to 12 characters. [...] I suggest you
    put long-winded filenames in a 'shar' before arcing them."

    Wikipedia: "ARC is incapable of compressing entire directory trees"

Known issues with our uarc:

- It reports '0' gid.
