                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

                         Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.  This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know
you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software.  If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
              DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to
any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed
as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as
to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it.  For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since
you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices.  Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from
time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If
the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are
different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.

[Warranty]
                       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will
be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General
Public License along with this program; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,
Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a
sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating
your program into proprietary programs.  If your program
is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
Library General Public License instead of this License.

 Ауторска права (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation,
 Inc. 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
 USA.

Дозвољено је умножавање и расподела дословног примерка
текста ове лиценце, али није дозвољено њено мењање.

			  Уговор

  За већину софтвера лиценце су начињене са циљем да вам
одузму слободу да га делите са другима и мењате. Насупрот
томе, ГНУ-ова општа јавна лиценца вам гарантује слободу
дељења и измене слободног софтвера да би осигурала слободу
софтвера за све његове кориснике. Ова Општа јавна лиценца
се односи на већину софтвера из Задужбине за слободни
софтвер и на сваки други програм, чији се аутори обавежу
на њено коришћење. (Други софтвер Задужбине за слободни
софтвер је уместо ове лиценце покривен ГНУ-овом
библиотечком општом јавном лиценцом (**).) И ви је можете
применити на ваше програме.

  Када говоримо о слободном софтверу, мислимо на слободу,
а не на цену. Наше опште јавне лиценце су замишљене да
осигурају вашу слободу расподеле примерака слободног
софтвера (и наплаћивања за ту услугу по жељи), примања
изворног кода или његовог добијања по жељи, могућности
измене софтвера или коришћења делова истог у новим
слободним програмима; и да вам дају до знања да то можете
да урадите.

  Да бисмо заштитили ваша права, морамо да поставимо
ограничења која забрањују било коме да вам оспори ова
права или да тражи од вас да их се одрекнете. Ова
ограничења су и обавезујућа за вас ако расподељујете
примерке софтвера, или га измените.

  На пример, ако расподељујете примерке таквог програма,
бесплатно или за одређену новчану надокнаду, морате дати и
примаоцима сва права која сами поседујете. Морате се
постарати да и они приме или могу да добију изворни код.
Најзад, морате им показати ове одредбе да би били упознати
са својим правима.

  Ми штитимо ваша права у два корака: (1) штитимо софтвер
заштитом ауторских права, и (2) нудимо вам ову лиценцу
која вам даје правну дозволу да умножавате, расподељујете
и/или мењате софтвер.

  Такође, ради заштите сваког аутора и нас хоћемо да се
осигурамо да свако разуме да не постоји гаранција за овај
слободни софтвер. Ако је софтвер неко други изменио и
проследио га, хоћемо да примаоци знају да оно што имају
није оригинал, тако да се било какви проблеми који су
настали због других, неће одразити на углед аутора
оригинала.

  Најзад, све слободне програме непрестано угрожавају
софтверски патенти. Ми хоћемо да избегнемо опасност да
расподељивачи слободног програма индивидуално добију
патентне лиценце и на тај начин ставе програм у приватно
власништво. Да бисмо спречили ово, јасно смо истакли да
сваки патент мора да буде лиценциран за свачију слободну
употребу или да уопште не буде лиценциран.

  Прецизне одредбе и услови умножавања, расподеле и измене
следе.

	       ГНУ-ОВА ОПШТА ЈАВНА ЛИЦЕНЦА
     ОДРЕДБЕ И УСЛОВИ УМНОЖАВАЊА, РАСПОДЕЛЕ И ИЗМЕНЕ

  0. Ова лиценца се односи на сваки програм или друго дело
које садржи саопштење власника ауторских права у ком стоји
да може бити расподељен под одредбама ове опште јавне
лиценце. ,,Програм`` ће надаље означавати сваки такав
програм или рад, а ,,дело засновано на Програму`` ће
означавати Програм или било који рад проистекао из њега по
Закону о ауторским правима; тј. дело које садржи Програм
или његов део, било дословни или са изменама и/или
преведен на други језик. (Одавде па надаље, превод је
укључен без ограничења у погледу израза ,,измена``.) Сваки
корисник лиценце је означен као ,,ви``.

Друге активности осим умножавања, расподеле и измене нису
обухваћене овом лиценцом; оне су изван њеног домена. Чин
покретања Програма није ограничен, а добијени резултат
извршавања Програма је обухваћен у случају да се његов
садржај састоји од дела заснованог на Програму (независно
од чињенице да је настао као резултат покретања Програма).
Ово непосредно зависи од тога шта Програм ради.

  1. Ви можете умножавати и расподелити дословне примерке
изворног кода Програма чим га примите, на било којем
медијуму, уз услов да на адекватан и одговарајући начин
означите на сваком примерку одговарајуће саопштење о
ауторским правима и објашњење гаранције; сачувате
недирнутим саопштења која се позивају на ову лиценцу и
одсуство било какве гаранције; и свим другим примаоцима
Програма дате примерак ове лиценце заједно са Програмом.

Ви можете наплаћивати новчану надокнаду за чин физичког
преноса примерка, и по вашем избору можете понудити
заштиту гаранцијом у замену за новчану надокнаду.


  2. Ви можете изменити ваш примерак или примерке Програма
или било ког његовог дела, образујући дело засновано на
Програму, и умножавати и расподелити такве измене или дела
под горњим одредбама члана 1, уз услов да сами такође
испуните сваки од следећих услова:

    а) морате осигурати да измењене датотеке носе уочљива
    обавештења да сте ви изменили датотеке као и датум
    било какве измене;

    б) морате осигурати да свако дело које расподељујете
    или издајете, а које у целини или делом садржи или је
    изведено из Програма или било ког његовог дела, буде
    лиценцирано у целини без новчане надокнаде свим трећим
    лицима под одредбама ове лиценце;

    в) ако измењени програм чита команде интерактивно када
    је покренут, ви морате осигурати да, када је покренут
    у циљу такве интерактивне употребе на уобичајен начин,
    испише или прикаже објаву која укључује одговарајуће
    саопштење о ауторским правима и саопштење да не
    постоји гаранција (или да ви дајете гаранцију) да
    корисници могу расподелити програм под овим условима,
    и објашњење кориснику како да прикаже примерак ове
    лиценце. (Изузетак: ако је Програм интерактиван али
    обично не исписује такву објаву, ваше дело засновано
    на Програму не мора да испише објаву.)


Ови захтеви се односе на измењено дело као целину. Ако
уочљиви делови таквог дела нису изведени из Програма, па
се могу разумно схватити као независна и одвојена дела за
себе, онда се ова лиценца и њене одредбе не односе на те
делове када их расподељујете као одвојена дела. Али када
расподељујете исте делове као део целине која је дело
засновано на Програму, расподела целине мора бити под
одредбама ове лиценце, чије дозволе за друге њене носиоце
се проширују на целину, а самим тим на сваки део без
обзира ко га је написао.

Намера овог члана није да тражи права или оспори ваша
права на дело које сте у целини написали; намера је
првенствено да се успостави право на контролу расподеле
изведених или колективних дела заснованих на Програму.

Само прикључивање Програму (или делу заснованом на
Програму) другог дела које на њему није засновано на
јединици за складиштење или медијуму за расподелу не
доводи друго дело под оквир ове лиценце.

  3. Можете умножавати и расподелити Програм (или дело
засновано на њему, по члану 2) у објектном коду или
извршном облику под горњим одредбама чланова 1 и 2 уз
услов да урадите једну од следећих ствари:

    а) да приложите уз њега потпуни одговарајући машински
    читљив изворни код, који мора бити расподељен према
    горњим одредбама чланова 1 и 2 на медијуму уобичајеном
    за размену софтвера; или,

    б) да приложите уз њега писмену понуду, важећу бар три
    године, о достављању било којој трећој страни, уз
    новчану надокнаду не већу од цене потребне да обавите
    физичку расподелу извора, потпуног машински читљивог
    примерка одговарајућег изворног кода, за расподелу
    према горњим одредбама чланова 1 и 2 на медијуму
    уобичајеном за размену софтвера; или,

    в) да приложите уз њега информацију коју сте добили
    као понуду о расподели одговарајућег изворног кода.
    (Ова могућност је дозвољена само за некомерцијалну
    расподелу и само ако сте добили програм у објектном
    коду или извршном виду уз такву понуду, према горњој
    тачки б.)

Изворни код дела подразумева облик дела најпогоднији за
прављење измена на њему. За дело у извршном облику,
потпуни изворни код подразумева сав изворни код за све
модуле које оно садржи, са додатком свих датотека који
дефинишу интеракцију и списа за контролу превођења и
инсталирања извршне верзије. Међутим, као посебан
изузетак, расподељени изворни код не мора да укључи све
што се обично расподељује (било у изворном или извршном
облику) са главним компонентама (преводиоцем, језгром, и
тако даље) оперативног система на ком се покреће извршна
датотека, осим уколико се сама та компонента не испоручује
са извршном датотеком.

Ако се расподела извршног или објектног кода врши понудом
приступа примерку са одређеног места, онда се понуда
истоветног изворног кода са истог места рачуна као
расподела изворног кода, чак и у случају када се од треће
стране не захтева да умножава изворни код заједно са
објектним кодом.

  4. Програм се не сме умножавати, мењати, подлиценцирати
или расподелити другачије него што је изричито истакнуто
овом лиценцом. Сваки другачији покушај умножавања, мењања,
подлиценцирања или расподеле програма није пуноважан и
аутоматски обуставља ваша права под овом лиценцом.
Међутим, странама које су од вас примиле примерак или
права под овом лиценцом неће се обуставити њихове лиценце
све док се оне потпуно придржавају њених одредби.

  5. Од вас се не тражи да прихватите ову лиценцу, пошто
је нисте потписали. Међутим, ништа друго вам не дозвољава
да мењате или расподељујете Програм или изведена дела.
Такве радње су забрањене законом уколико не прихватите ову
лиценцу. Тако, изменом или расподелом Програма (или дела
заснованог на Програму), прихватате да то урадите под овом
лиценцом и под свим њеним одредбама и условима за
умножавање, расподелу или измену Програма или дела
заснованих на њему.

  6. Сваки пут када расподељујете Програм (или било које
дело засновано на Програму), прималац ће аутоматски
примити лиценцу од првобитног носиоца за умножавање,
расподелу или измену Програма према овим одредбама и
условима. Ви не можете даље ограничити примаочево
коришћење овде датих права, као што ви нисте ни одговорни
ако трећа страна наметне усклађивање са одредбама ове
лиценце.

  7. Ако су вам, као последица судске пресуде или под
изговором кршења патента или било каквог другог разлога
(не ограничавајући се искључиво на питања патената),
наметнути услови (било судским налогом, поравнањем или
другачије) који су у супротности са условима ове лиценце,
они вас не изузимају од услова ове лиценце. Ако је
расподела или било која друга ваша применљива обавеза у
супротности са овом лиценцом, онда као последицу тога не
можете уопште расподелити Програм. На пример, ако патентна
лиценца не дозвољава бесплатну расподелу Програма од
стране свих прималаца примерка или индиректно преко вас,
онда је једини начин да се задовољи и ова лиценца да се у
потпуности одрекнете расподеле Програма.

Ако се било који део овог члана означи као неодговарајући
или неприменљив под било којом одређеном околношћу,
примењује се остатак члана а члан као целина се примењује
под другим околностима.

Циљ овог члана није да вас наведе да прекршите било које
патенте или друга права на својину нити да оспори
валидност таквих права; овај члан има за свој једини циљ
заштиту интегритета система расподеле слободног софтвера,
који је имплементиран применом јавних лиценци. Многи људи
су дали свој несебични допринос у широком спектру софтвера
расподељеног кроз овај систем, ослањајући се на његову
доследну примену; на аутору/донатору је да одлучи да ли је
вољан/вољна да расподељује софтвер кроз било који систем,
а лиценца не може наметнути тај избор.

Овај члан треба да детаљно разјасни оно што може бити
последица остатка ове лиценце.

  8. Ако су расподела и/или коришћење Програма забрањени у
одређеним земљама, било патентима или ауторским правима,
првобитни носилац ауторских права који стави Програм под
ову лиценцу може да приложи експлицитно географско
ограничење расподеле, које искључује такве земље; тако да
је расподела дозвољена само у земљи или земљама које нису
искључене на такав начин. У том случају, ова лиценца
укључује ограничење као да је део њеног текста.

  9. Задужбина за слободни софтвер може повремено објавити
ревидиране и/или нове верзије Опште јавне лиценце. Такве
ревизије ће бити сличне по духу садашњој верзији, али се
могу разликовати у детаљима у циљу разрешења нових
проблема или питања.

Свака верзија ће добити различит број. Ако Програм истиче
број верзије Лиценце која се примењује на њега и текст ,,и
било која следећа верзија``, можете примењивати одредбе и
услове те или било које следеће верзије коју објави
Задужбина за слободни софтвер. Ако Програм не истиче број
верзије ове лиценце, можете изабрати било коју верзију
коју је објавила Задужбина за слободни софтвер.

  10. Ако желите да употребите делове Програма у другим
слободним програмима чији су услови расподеле другачији,
пишите аутору и замолите га за дозволу. За софтвер над
којим ауторска права има Задужбина за слободни софтвер,
пишите Задужбини за слободни софтвер; ми понекад начинимо
изузетке за овакве ствари. Наша одлука ће бити мотивисана
са два циља: чувања слободног статуса свега што је
изведено из нашег слободног софтвера и промовисања дељења
и поновне употребе софтвера уопште.

		  КРАЈ ОДРЕДБИ И УСЛОВА

   Како да примените ове одредбе на ваше нове програме

  Ако развијете нови програм и желите да буде што
кориснији јавности, најбољи начин да то постигнете је да
га означите као слободни софтвер који свако може
расподелити и мењати под овим одредбама.

  Да бисте то урадили, додајте следећа обавештења вашем
програму. Најсигурније је да их додате на почетак сваке
изворне датотеке, да бисте најефикасније саопштили
одсуство гаранције; свака датотека требало би да садржи
најмање линију са ауторским правима и информацију где се
може пронаћи пуно обавештење.

    <у једној линији наведите назив програма и кратак опис
    онога шта ради.>
    Ауторска права (C) <гггг> <име аутора>

    Овај програм је слободни софтвер; можете га
    расподелити и/или мењати под одредбама ГНУ-ове опште
    јавне лиценце коју је објавила Задужбина за слободни
    софтвер; и то, било верзије 2 Лиценце, или (по вашем
    избору) било које следеће верзије.

    Овај програм се расподељује у намери да буде користан,
    али БЕЗ ИКАКВЕ ГАРАНЦИЈЕ; чак и без имплицитне
    гаранције КОМЕРЦИЈАЛНЕ ВРЕДНОСТИ или ИСПУЊАВАЊА
    ОДРЕЂЕНЕ ПОТРЕБЕ. Погледајте ГНУ-ову општу јавну
    лиценцу за више детаља.

    Требало би да примите примерак ГНУ-ове опште јавне
    лиценце заједно са овим програмом; ако то није случај,
    пишите Задужбини за слободни софтвер на адресу: Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
    Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.

Такође додајте обавештење како вам се може јавити преко
електронске и обичне поште.

Ако је програм интерактиван, треба да исписује кратко
саопштење слично овом при покретању у интерактивном
режиму:

    Гномовизија верзија 69, Ауторска права (C) година име
    аутора Гномовизија се испоручује БЕЗ ИКАКВЕ ГАРАНЦИЈЕ;
    за детаље откуцајте `прикажи г'. Ово је слободни
    софтвер, а ви сте позвани да га расподелите под
    извесним условима; откуцајте `прикажи у' за детаље.

Хипотетичке команде `прикажи г' и `прикажи у' би требало
да прикажу одговарајуће делове Опште јавне лиценце.
Наравно, команде које ви користите могу се разликовати од
`прикажи г' и `прикажи у'; то чак могу бити и кликови
мишем или ставке менија или нешто што највише одговара
вашем програму.

Такође би требало да затражите од вашег послодавца (ако
сте запослени као програмер) или ваше школе (ако сте у
школи) да потпише ,,објашњење ауторских права`` за
програм, у случају да је то потребно. На пример (измените
имена):

  Јојодин, д.д., се овим одриче свих ауторских права за
  програм `Гномовизија' (који пролази кроз преводиоце)
  који је написао Петар Хакер.

  <потпис Тај Куна>, 1. април 1989.
  Тај Кун, председник пода

Ова општа јавна лиценца не дозвољава укључење вашег
програма у програме у приватном власништву. Ако је ваш
програм библиотека рутина, може вам бити корисније да
дозволите повезивање власничких апликација са библиотеком.
Ако је то оно што желите, користите ГНУ-ову библиотечку
општу јавну лиценцу (**) уместо ове лиценце.
