This file documents some conventions for sorting system header files in
the #include section.

1. #include <config.h> unconditionally

2. if there are any headers containing "alloca" in the name, include
   them here. Some systems need them as the first header.

3. #include the Standard C Library headers, sorted alphabetically

   (assert, ctype, errno, float, limits, locale, math, setjmp, signal,
   stdarg, stddef, stdio, stdlib, string, time)

4. #include the POSIX headers, in the following order

   <sys/types.h>		Needed by many other headers.
   <sys/*.h>
   <*.h>

   For every POSIX function you use, make sure that the order of the
   headers is the same as in the according manpage.
   
5. #include other external headers

6. #include "../src/global.h"

   This file contains lots of compatibility stuff that is used
   throughout the whole mc. All mc header files rely on this file to be
   included before them.

7. #include Midnight Commander headers

   Currently, not all headers can be ordered arbitrarily, so try it out.


==== Headers that may be included unconditionally ====

<sys/types.h>
<sys/stat.h>
<unistd.h>
<fcntl.h>

==== Headers that need autoconf guards ====

<termios.h>
<sys/ioctl.h>
