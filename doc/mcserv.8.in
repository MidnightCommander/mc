mcserv \- Midnight Commander file server.
.SH USAGE
.B mcserv
[\-diqvf] [\-p portnum]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
mcserv is the server program for the Midnight Commander networking
file system.  It provides access to the host file system to clients
running the Midnight file system (currently, only the Midnight
Commander file manager).
.PP
If the program is run as root the program will try to get a reserved
port otherwise it will use 9876 as the port.
.PP
If the system has a portmapper running, then the port will be
registered with the portmapper and thus clients will automatically
connect to the right port.  If the system does not have a portmapper,
then a port should be manually specified with the -p option (see
below). 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-d"
Become a daemon, you should use this flag if you start the program
from one of the system startup files.  This flag will make the program
handle any number of incoming requests by forking a new copy of itself
for each client.
.TP
.I "-q"
Quiet mode.
.TP
.I "-p"
To make the server listen on the specified 
.B portnum
port.
.TP
.I "-f"
Allow ftp authentication as a fallback if the other methods fail.
This is only useful on systems where the password checking method is not
supported by this version of mcserv.  The local ftp server is contacted
with the username and password.  The user is authenticated if the ftp
server accepts the credentials.  Use this option with care and only
when necessary.
.TP
.I "-v"
Toggle on the verbose mode.

.SH BUGS
This program currently uses port 9876, and not a system secure port.
This is a potential security problem since it could be run by any user
on the system if the system daemon is not running.
